	Update for 0.6.0 release

	Refresh translations

	Fix virt-viewer.exe on win32
	Libvirt uses gnulib for making winsock look like POSIX
	sockets. This means that in the libvirt event handle
	callbacks the application will be given a file descriptor
	rather than a winsock HANDLE object. The g_io_channel_unix_new
	method will detect that it is an FD and delegate to the
	g_io_channel_win32_new_fd method. Unfortunately the glib Win32
	event loop impl is not very good at dealing with FD objects,
	simulating poll() by doing a read() on the FD :-(

	The API docs for g_io_channel_win32_new_fd say

	 "All reads from the file descriptor should be done by
	  this internal GLib thread. Your code should call only
	  g_io_channel_read()."

	This isn't going to fly for libvirt, since it has zero
	knowledge of glib at all, so is just doing normal read().

	Fortunately we can work around this problem by turning
	the FD we get from libvirt back into a HANDLE using the
	_get_osfhandle() method.

	Don't use --nodeps for developer builds
	Only use --nodeps when running under the autobuild engine

	Load ui files first from installed location
	virt_viewer_util_load_ui() looks first in the current directory, and then looks
	in the system data dirs for a ui file to load, but if you install virt-viewer in
	a different prefix, it will load the system UI file rather than the one from the
	install prefix. Try to load the ui file from pkgdatadir first.

	Clear global zoom-reset hotkey too

	Fix rebuild of accelerators menu when loading from file
	It's not enough to set the property to notify of its change. Add a
	virt_viewer_app_set_enable_accel() helper, and call it after the changes
	to accelerators are made when loading from file.

	I verified the menu is correctly built when connection from controller
	or command line too.

	Disable mime database update during make distcheck
	Updating the mime database creates files in the install directory, and
	these files are not cleaned up on make uninstall, so this causes a make
	distcheck failure.

	spec: Get BuildRequires min versions from configure.ac
	We currently duplicate the minimum requirements for the various virt-viewer
	dependencies in configure.ac, virt-viewer.spec.in and mingw-virt-viewer.spec.in
	This commit uses the versions set in configure.ac in the 2 .spec.in files
	so that it's easier to keep them in sync

	Before/after diff of the .spec files are:

	Update spice-gtk requirement everywhere
	d1c2bc1 updated configure.ac spice-gtk requirement to 0.22, but did not
	update the various places which duplicated this requirement, namely the
	.spec.in files and the README file.

	Update shared mime database on install/uninstall
	remomte-viewer installs a file to $datadir/share/mime to register a
	mime-type for its .vv files. However, after installing this file,
	update-mime-database must be run in order to update the shared mime
	database. This commit (inspired by what Nautilus/planner are doing) adds
	what is needed for that.
	If the mime type is not correctly registered, gvfs-info console.vv will not
	return the correct mime type, and xdg-open console.vv will fail to start
	remote-viewer, and will fall back to running gedit as the .vv file is a
	text file.

	Enable the display before showing the window
	This ensures that the display is enabled when it gets its first Allocate event
	(which causes a display reconfiguration).  If the display is not enabled at this
	point, it won't send down a new monitors_config message until the second
	allocation, which may result in the display being disabled until a window is
	resized.

	Disable govirt support on f19
	The govirt package in f19 is an older one, and does not have some of the
	functions used since the switch to govirt 0.3.0. As 0.3.0 broke ABI, it's
	not convenient to backport it to f19.
	Update the spec file to reflect the fact that oVirt support in git is no
	longer buildable on f19.

	Remove obsolete function declaration
	This function was removed in bd914bdea2e85d62d5f67eb567ce200f526c6bab, but the
	declaration was missed.

	Create a sparse array for monitor-geometry-changed
	It's possible to have only display N enabled without having all of the displays
	before it. I experienced this a couple times with a windows guest where display
	1 would show up before display 0 and we'd hit a warning that nth is not less
	than nmonitors. So find the highest display ID and then create an array of that
	size, leaving missing displays initialized to 0

	Don't re-configure displays when show-hint changes
	This caused secondary displays on a windows guest to flicker under some
	circumstances. The old code didn't re-configure displays in this case either, so
	it shouldn't have been included in the display alignment refactor.

	Do all display alignment in virt-viewer
	Don't rely on spice-gtk to do any alignment of displays.  This patch sets the
	disable-display-align property on the SpiceMainChannel, and makes the
	VirtViewerSession in charge of doing all alignment. This means that every
	display has to tell the VirtViewerSession when its "virtual monitor" has changed
	configuration (and wants to reconfigure its display on the guest), rather than
	sending it directly to the Main Channel.  The session will then align the
	displays (if necessary), and the spice session will send down new configuration
	for all displays at once. This solves a couple of problems:

	1. It allows the session to send down absolute coordinates only in the case
	   where *all* windows are fullscreen (so that we can still support
	   vertically-stacked displays, etc).  But it auto-aligns displays if only a
	   subset of the displays are in fullscreen mode. This solves the problem of
	   overlapping regions on different displays when one monitor is in fullscreen
	   because only one monitor's configuration was updated and the others were not
	   aligned.
	2. Allows us to always align based on the current position of each display. This
	   contrasts with the earlier behavior where the position used for alignment was
	   the window's position at the time when it was last resized. This caused
	   displays to be arranged in a seemingly non-deterministic manner if one window
	   was moved and then another window was resized (causing a display
	   re-configuration).

	Ensure all windows obey initial --zoom setting
	There are cases where multiple VirtViewerWindow objects are created before the
	VirtViewerApp constructor has a chance to run. Since the constructor has not yet
	run, priv->main_window will still be NULL, the test in
	virt_viewer_app_window_new() will fail, and they will not get their initial zoom
	level set.  When the constructor finally runs, it set the zoom level of the main
	window to the value set on the command line, but all other windows that had
	already been created retained the default 100% zoom level.

	By creating the main_window in the instance init function, we ensure that the
	main window is created before we get any 'session-display-added' signals and all
	displays will start out with consistent zoom levels.

	Remove non-functional VIRT_VIEWER_HIDE env behavior
	VIRT_VIEWER_HIDE could be set as an environment variable to (theoretically) hide
	displays whenever they were not ready.  Unfortunately, this bit of functionality
	appears bitrotten and doesn't work anymore (it prevents windows from opening
	when you click 'view > displays > display 2', for instance).

	separate fullscreen_set_active into a separate function

	Ensure auto-conf is only done once
	Auto-conf should only happen at startup. It is triggered from several places due
	to the somewhat unreliable ordering of events, but that doesn't mean we want to
	run it several times. This patch ensures that we only do it once.

	Add ability to define custom display->monitor mapping per vm
	Fullscreen mode generally just assigns display 1 to monitor 1, display 2 to
	monitor 2, etc. For custom setups, you can define a monitor mapping in the
	settings keyfile per-vm. This requires a vm uuid (so only works in virt-viewer
	or on versions of spice-server that send the uuid over the wire).  The format is
	pretty basic:

	    [6485b20f-e9da-614c-72b0-60a7857e7886]
	    monitor-mapping=2;3

	The group name ("6485b20f-e9da-614c-72b0-60a7857e7886") is the uuid id of the
	vm. This group has a single key: monitor-mapping. This key is an array of
	integers describing the order in which to assign the monitors to a guest
	display. Any monitors that are not listed in this array will not be configured
	at startup.  For instance:

	    monitor-mapping=2;1

	will attempt to configure 2 displays on the guest and assign the first display
	to monitor 2 and the second display to monitor 1.

	    monitor-mapping=2

	will only configure a single display on the guest and place it on the second
	monitor.  Any monitor numbers listed in the keyfile are greater than the number
	of monitors that are physically present, they will be ignored.

	Fix leak of VirtViewerApp::windows hash table key
	The VirtViewerApp::windows hash table owns the memory for both the keys
	and values it stores. virt_viewer_app_remove_nth_window() uses
	g_hash_table_steal() which does not call the 'free' function neither for
	the key nor for the value. This method takes care of releasing the
	reference for the value it extracted from the hash table, but not for the
	key.
	This commit fixes by explicitly taking a reference on the value rather than
	stealing the one held by the hash table. We can then replace the use of
	g_hash_table_steal() with g_hash_table_remove() which will take care of
	freeing the removed key.

	session: Don't hold VirtViewerDisplay refs on channel destroy
	VirtViewerSessionSpice creates a reference-holding VirtViewerDisplay
	array and associates it with the display SpiceChannel with
	g_object_set_data(channel, "virt-viewer-displays").

	When virt_viewer_session_spice_channel_destroy() is called and the display
	channel is being destroyed, we should ensure these VirtViewerDisplay
	references are dropped or the displays could outlive the session.

	In my testing (start qemu with a f20 live cd, connect to it, when the
	kernel has started booting and qxl is initialized (4 displays listed in the
	display submenu), kill qemu), I was getting "invalid unclassed pointer in
	cast to 'VirtViewerSessionSpice'" warnings through

	Hide all windows on disconnection
	When starting remote-viewer without argument, we are showing a
	window where the user can enter connection details. We then
	go on to try and connect to the URI the user specified, and if
	the connection fails, we disconnect from the remote server, and then
	we show again the connection window so that the user can correct the
	URI if he entered it wrong.
	However, when this happens, the window for the previous connection
	will still be visible even if connection failed. To avoid this,
	this commit makes sure we hide all windows when we get a disconnection
	event.

	Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1024309

	Reshow connection dialog on errors
	remote-viewer behaviour is currently inconsistent in the connection dialog:
	if the user enters a valid URI, but then remote-viewer fails to connect
	to it, then we'll show again the connection dialog through a call
	to virt_viewer_app_start() in remote_viewer_deactivated(). If instead we
	enter an invalid URI in the connection dialog, then remote-viewer will
	report an error and quit.

	This commit makes sure in the latter case, we report the error and show
	again the connection dialog. The user can press 'Cancel' in the
	connection dialog to get out of remote-viewer as in this case, we
	return directly FALSE rather than going through the cleanup: label
	and looping.

	Handle virt_viewer_app_start() errors
	remote_viewer_deactivated() can be calling virt_viewer_app_start()
	without checking whether it returns TRUE or FALSE. It returns FALSE
	when it was not successful (when it failed to parse the URI to connect
	to for example, or whe the user presses Cancel in the connection dialog).

	This means that if the user starts remote-viewer, enters a valid URI
	in the connection dialog to which it cannot connect to
	(spice://example.com:999) and then presses Cancel in the connection
	dialog that appears after the connection  failure, then remote-viewer
	will be sitting there with an empty window doing nothing.

	This commit ensures we chain to the parent class when
	virt_viewer_app_start() returns FALSE, which causes remote-viewer to
	exit.

	Fix window title after failed connection
	When using the connection dialog, if the user picks an invalid
	URI first causing a failed connection, and then picks/enters a valid
	URI, remote-viewer window title will be set to the first invalid URI,
	not to the second one which was entered.

	As the user may have specified a window title to use on the command
	line (-t option), we need to be careful not to override that when
	setting the window title on the second attempt.

	Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1024309

	build-sys: Use gtk+ 3.0 by default
	virt-viewer currenty builds with gtk+ 2.0 by default. Nowadays, gtk+ 2.0 is

	gtk+ 3.0. This commit switches the default to gtk+ 3.0

	Disconnect fullscreen map-event handler when leaving fullscreen
	When we enter fullscreen mode before the window is shown, we set up a signal
	handler to enter fullscreen mode when the window is mapped.  If we then leave
	fullscreen mode before the window is mapped, we don't disconnect this handler,
	so it will still enter fullscreen mode when it is shown.

	Fixes rhbz #1009513

	Drop basic fullscreen mode
	Remove the distinction between --full-screen and --full-screen=auto-conf.  Just
	make --full-screen behave like auto-conf did.  There's really no advantage to

	ovirt: Only set SPICE CA cert if it's non NULL
	We currently reuse the oVirt CA cert for SPICE connection as well,
	but it may not be set. When this happens, we don't want to try to use
	it.

	ovirt: Don't automatically download CA certificate
	The CA certificate to use to authenticate the various hosts in
	an oVirt instance can be fetched from https://ovirt.example.com/ca.crt.
	However, the gio API we are using does not seem to be checking the
	server-side certificate of ovirt.example.com before connecting to it,
	which could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. Now that the CA
	certificate to use can be specified from the command line using
	--ovirt-ca-file, we can remove this automatic fetching of the CA
	certificate.

	ovirt: Honour oVirt command line options
	libgovirt 0.3.0 and newer can be passed from the commandline a CA
	certificate to use during SSL communications. This commit adds support
	for this option to remote-viewer.

	Clean-up spaces before/after URI in connection dialog
	When starting remote-viewer with no argument, a connection dialog
	is shown. If the URI the user types in this dialog as trailing
	or leading spaces, then connection will fail because remote-viewer
	will keep them as if they were significant.
	This commit makes sure we remove spaces at the beginning/end of
	the URI before trying to use it.

	Make 'Send' menu items with defined accels work in fullscreen

	Set Spice display to fullscreen if owning window is pending fullscreen
	When you call virt_viewer_window_enter_fullscreen() on a hidden window, it
	didn't actually change its fullscreen state.  Instead, it sets up a map-event
	handler to enter fullscreen after it is shown. When _set_display() is called on
	a window that is pending fullscreen status, it initially sets the fullscreen
	state of the display to FALSE, which can cause an unwanted resize to be sent
	down to the guest. This patch changes the behavior to set its fullscreen state
	to TRUE even before the window is shown.

	Don't freeze property notifications when adding new displays
	Freezing property notifications prevents VirtViewerDisplaySpice from
	synchronizing its fullscreen/auto-resize state with the base class until after
	the notifications are thawed.  During the time that notifications were frozen,
	an allocation happens. The action we take on an allocation event depends on the
	current state of the auto_resize variable, so this can result in an unwanted
	resize.

	VirtViewerDisplaySpice: use enum type for auto_resize
	Instead of storing the auto_resize member as an integer, use the enum, it makes
	it slightly easier for debugging. Also, explicitly initialize the value.

	Avoid extra zoom-level property notifications
	When setting a display's zoom level to the same level as the current setting,
	return early so that we don't notify about a property change

	Don't disable fullscreen if kiosk mode is off
	This conflicts with the --full-screen switch, because if kiosk mode is disabled,
	it sets disables fullscreen mode, which overrides the earlier call to enable
	fullscreen.

	Make 'Cancel' the default action in exit dialog
	In the 'Do you want to close the session dialog?', the default focus
	is currently on the 'Do not ask me again' checkbox.
	The purpose of this dialog is to make sure that the user does not
	inadvertantly exit remote-viewer, this commit changes the default

	'Do not ask me again 'checkbox.

	Update hotkeys documentation in manpage
	Describe the expected behavior of the hotkey bindings in a bit more detail.

	Add ability to use 'End' key in hotkeys
	ctrl_key_to_gtk_key() capitalizes all key names not explicitly specified in the
	translation table.  So 'end' becomes 'END', which is not a valid key name
	according to GTK+.  Un-comment out the 'end' item from the table and set it to
	the properly capitalized key name ("End").

	This allows users to specify e.g. "ctrl+alt+end" as a hotkey for
	sending the secure attention sequence.

	Add ability to send Secure attention sequence via keyboard
	On Windows, the OS doesn't allow applications to handle Ctrl+Alt+Del, because
	it's handled by the OS at a much lower level. Although we have a menu item to
	send this sequence to the guest, it's not possible to send via the keyboard (in
	the windows client). So add an alternative key sequence (defaulting to
	Ctrl+Alt+End) to send this sequence to the guest.

	kiosk: explicit resize window to fullscreen size
	Allow to run the client in kiosk mode with window-manager-less
	environment.

	This was a conditional workaroud on win32. I am making it
	non-conditional to make fullscreen work on non-wm environment. Hence
	I don't see the need to refer explicitely to the bug workaround, since
	it is no longer something that should be removed, even when bgo 652049
	is fixed.

	kiosk: don't open extra monitors
	In kiosk mode, we don't want new monitors windows that wouldn't fit on
	the client monitors to come up.

	kiosk: warn and prevent if app want to quit or window to hide
	These condition shouldn't happen, they are here for debugging
	purposes (ie file a bug if it happens).

	kiosk: add --kiosk-quit option
	In kiosk mode, it's useful to keep the app alive, even if the remote
	session ended for example. Ie, we want to prevent the app from quiting
	itself, even if the remote end closed, lost network, or crashed etc.

	kiosk: teach a window to become kiosk-mode
	Remove the toolbar, disable modifiers.

	kiosk: keep a reference on the toolbar
	We are going to change the container content dynamically, so we need a
	strong reference.

	kiosk: use less verbose window/display status
	We want extra windows to remain blank after connection.

	For example, if the remote has a single monitor, and client has more, we
	don't want extra client monitors to say "Connected to graphic server"
	all the time on other monitors. Instead, we leave them empty/black in
	kiosk mode.

	kiosk: open a window on each client monitor
	Open a window on each client monitor in fullscreen. If the remote
	display has less monitors than the client, the extra client monitors
	will still be used to prevent the user from accessing the windows or
	desktop below, and also to show some status messages when necessary.

	kiosk: add app kiosk option, pass it down to window
	See man page update for details.

	Return existing window in app_window_new()
	Since the returned window is weak, it can already returns existing
	windows (instead of creating one and failing to insert).

	This allows the following set_kiosk() function to create a main window
	before the app constructor is called.

	Define the min/max zoom levels, so all values are sync

	Hide extra monitors that don't fit in auto-conf

	virt-viewer: Allow TLS-only SPICE connections
	When trying to connect to a VM which uses SPICE with only a tls port
	set:
	<graphics type='spice' tlsPort='-1' autoport='no' listen='0' keymap='en-us'>
	    <listen type='address' address='0'/>
	</graphics>
	the connection will fail with
	"Cannot determine the graphic address for the guest spice"

	virt_viewer_extract_connect_info() indeed assumes that if no
	non-TLS port is set, then this means we are trying to connect through
	an already open socket, and otherwise the connection fails.
	The presence of a TLS port is only checked when a non-TLS port is set.

	This commit reworks that logic to start by extracting both the non-TLS
	and TLS ports (only when using SPICE for the latter), and by only trying
	to parse the socket to use if none of these 2 ports is set

	This fixes rhbz#982840

	usbredir: Don't depend on channel ordering
	Before this patch-set virt-viewer was calling spice_session_has_channel_type(
	session, SPICE_CHANNEL_USBREDIR) from the session-initialized signal handler,

	So as soon as the display channel gets added to the session, the check was
	done. This causes the check to return FALSE for usbredir capable vms if
	the usbredir channel(s) get added to the session after the display channed.

	gtk-3: Rework window size handling
	With gtk-2 we have a special hack, where at first we make the
	virt-viewer-display request its actual size, and then once the window is
	mapped, we request a size of 50x50 to allow the user to resize the window
	to something smaller.

	With gtk-3 >= 3.8.1 this is broken, and the window gets resized to a
	smaller size as soon as we change the size request to 50x50.

	gtk-3 has a much better way of dealing with this in the form of widgets
	being able to specify both a minimal and a natural size. This patch changes
	virt-viewer to use this with gtk-3, instead of the gtk-2 hack.

	ovBox: Make get_preferred_width/height differentiate between min and natural
	gtk-3's widget size negotiation code differentiates between the minimum

	virt-viewer-app: Always allow users to close displays from the displays menu
	Marking display menu items as non sensitive for shown displays make no sense,
	since the user can always close them through the window-manager.

	Having a window for a display shown when the display is not selectable nor
	ready, can happen when the agent goes away. This happens for example when using
	a dual monitor config with a Linux guest and then switching to a text console
	inside the guest.

	Use translations when looking up key combination to send
	virt_viewer_window_menu_send() compares the label of the menu item
	that was clicked on with a list of known labels to know which
	key combination should be sent to the guest.
	However, the menu label can be translated, but the table doing
	the label -> key combination mapping uses untranslated labels.
	This means the menu item will not send any key combination when
	clicked if translated.
	This can be observed with fr_FR where "Ctrl+Alt+_Del" is translated
	to "Ctrl+Alt+_Suppr".

	Remove gtk_window_present() call
	gtk_window_present() may forcefully call gdk_window_show(), which will

	Vista+. For example, a snapped window will be moved back to its

	Gtk+ ShowWindow() is currently using SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE, it should

	With commit 81ed9d13 "virt_viewer_window_enter_fullscreen: Pass in monitor for

	Since the VirtViewerDisplay needs to know the fullscreen monitor number too,

	always have a display, leading to errors like:

	virt_viewer_display_get_monitor: assertion `VIRT_VIEWER_IS_DISPLAY(self)'

	And to the monitor number not always being stored. This patchset fixes this

	virt-viewer-display-spice: Use display monitor property for fullscreen size

	But this is racy, sometimes the size_allocate function runs before the move

	virtviewer-window: Make sure fullscreen window stays on the same monitor
	Sometimes the guest may shortly disable and then re-enable a monitor while
	in fullscreen mode, this happens for example when changing display resolution
	through gnome-display-properties inside the guest. This causes the client
	window-manager to remap the window, and this can cause it to end up
	on a different monitor.

	This patch fixes this by remembering the position the window is places at
	when going fullcreen and moving it there again when its gets (re-)shown.

	Fix "Do not ask me again" checkbox settings saving
	Based on bug report by Hans:

	The code block for saving was below this check:

	    if (priv->session) {
	        virt_viewer_session_close(VIRT_VIEWER_SESSION(priv->session));
	        if (priv->connected) {
	            priv->quiting = TRUE;
	            return;
	        }
	    }

	Which means it never executes when quiting virt-viewer while conneced, causing
	the "Do not ask me again" checkbox settings to not be saved.

	usbredir: Fix usbredir menu always being grayed out on monitor 2+

	virt-viewer-display-spice: Pass proper x and y coordinates in windowed mode
	This stops monitor order from the guest from being re-arranged in multi-
	monitor setups when switching between fullscreen and windowed mode.

	Note this relies on spice-gtk's auto monitor alignment code, which currently
	does not properly handle setups where there is more then 1 row of monitors,
	ie 2x1 - 5x1 will work fine, but 2x2 will not.

	virt-viewer-display-spice: Use real monitor coordinates in fullscreen
	Now that we pass the real monitor coordinates, tell spice-gtk to use them,
	rather then to use the passed coordinates as input for its automatic monitor
	alignment. This fixes ie monitors in a 2x2 grid, showing up as a 4x1
	configuration in the guest.

	Improve check for overridden grab key combination

	so.

	Don't leak SpiceGrabSequence in enable_accel_changed

	Improve hotkeys controller behaviour
	Disable default accelerators when setting bindings from the controller

	Allow to save to other formats than png
	Currently, the screenshots can only be saved to png. This commit

	spice: only autoresize once with screen size in fullscreen
	It's currently not possible to configure guest with higher resolution

	special-case fullscreen mode, and only resize when entering
	fullscreen. Furthermore, it avoids sending extra unnecessary resize

	window.

	It is legitimate not to force that 1x1 window resize when toggling the

	the remote desktop ends up being resize, that will trigger another
	virt_viewer_set_desktop_size() and finally change the window size

2012-08-10  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Use real binary name in help message
	Now that we have 2 distinct binaries, remote-viewer and virt-viewer,
	'PACKAGE' can no longer be used in error messages as the name of the
	binary. This causes a small inconsistency when running
	'remote-viewer --foobar' as the error message would be:
	'Unknown option --foobar
	Run 'virt-viewer --help' to see a full list of available command line options'

	This commit makes sure we use argv[0] for this message.
	Fixes rhbz#814150

2012-07-23  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	Show status page by default if display not ready
	Switch back to status page if display is not ready.

	Make status widget visible immediately
	GtkNotebook will use the currently visible widget as default page.
	If we don't show status widget before we append the display, the
	current page will be on display. Quoting Gtk+ documentation:

	"Note that due to historical reasons, GtkNotebook refuses to switch to
	a page unless the child widget is visible. Therefore, it is
	recommended to show child widgets before adding them to a notebook."

	vnc: when session is disconnected, make the display as non-ready

	Simplify display flag handling

	Add VirtViewerSession::session-display-updated
	Rebuild menu when agent is connected. Only when the agent is running
	may a display be enabled/disabled.

	Make the display submenu insensitive if display can't be selected

	spice: factor out main channel lookup code

	Add VirtViewerDisplay::selectable property
	This property will be set when the display can be selected to be
	"enabled" and shown (this can involve creating/connecting an
	additional guest monitor, and may need guest agent cooperation for
	example).

	Add virt_viewer_window_get_display()
	Getter used in following changes.

	Hook up handling of Monitors
	Rely on spice-gtk display channel monitors property to manage
	displays. The same display channel may now provide several monitors,
	the SpiceDisplay widget must be told which monitor to display

	Bump glib > 2.22, add compat file
	We use API from 2.22, and some from further version. Add
	virt-glib-compat.h fallback file for those.

	Use SpiceDisplay:ready property instead of channel mark
	The display can now check several conditions before the display can be
	shown, use that instead of display mark, which was not high-level
	enough.

	Number display starting from 1

	Prevent from adding the same display several time in the session
	In virt_viewer_session_spice_display_monitors(), we (re)add the
	display unconditionnaly every time we receive a new MonitorConfig.

	Add a DISABLED display hint
	This flag will help to track whether the display has been
	removed/closed and whether it really has a valid display.

	Ready in contrast, is used to "hide" temporarily the display (when
	starting or redrawing the display, to avoid artifacts)

	Use virt_viewer_connect_object() for display
	When display is released, detach signal automatically.

	Fix various crash related to not cleaning up signal handlers properly,
	due to no longer 1-1 only relation between display widget and channel.

	Rebuild display menu when a window is added or removed

	Mark a menu string as translatable

	Run-time check values before doing bad computation

	Turn display:show-hint into flags type

	Destroy dialog immediately after run
	If the parent is already destroyed, it looks like the dialog is
	destroyed too. This avoids a crash when calling app_quit().

	build: generate enums type boilerplate

	spice: disconnect signal handlers when either object is destroyed
	Use virt_viewer_signal_connect_object(), a copy of telepathy
	utility function tp_g_signal_connect_object(). This function
	will take care of removing signal handler if any of emitter or
	attached object are destroyed.

	The following patches will have this condition met, since there is no
	longer 1-1 relation between channel and display. The channels can
	continue to be around when some of the display are removed.

	spice: improve fullscreen=auto-conf
	Do keep client monitor position, do not align monitors automatically.
	The align property is only available since v0.12.101.

2012-07-03  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	build: allow building with newer glibc-headers and -O0
	    Fix copied from libvirt, commit by Eric Blake.

	    glibc 2.15 (on Fedora 17) coupled with explicit disabling of
	    optimization during development dies a painful death:

	    /usr/include/features.h:314:4: error: #warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O) [-Werror=cpp]

	    Work around this by only conditionally defining _FORTIFY_SOURCE,
	    in the case where glibc can actually use it.  The trick is using
	    AH_VERBATIM instead of AC_DEFINE.

2012-06-15  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Revert "Fix virt_viewer_app_activate return value"
	This reverts commit 3ce6df7c309068f36e2602692da809a153ed5688. This
	commit broke virt-viewer which expects this function to return -1
	or 0 on error, and a positive value on success in
	virt_viewer_initial_connect.

2012-06-13  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix virt_viewer_app_activate return value
	VirtViewerApp::activate is expected to return -1 on errors.
	It calls the VirtViewerSession::open_* methods, which return FALSE
	on error. However, VirtViewerApp::activate directly returns these
	boolean instead of testing the returned value and properly returning
	-1 on errors. This caused errors in these open methodes to be ignored.

	Fix various memory leaks

	spice: use weak references to display channel
	Fix switch-host migration with Spice.

	spice-gtk doesn't like channels staying around when they should be
	destroyed/finalized, ie removed from session.

	spice-gtk should probably learned to handle better the case of non
	cooperating clients, and be able to dissociate a channel from a
	session without waiting for it to be disposed, but for now, the
	relation is quite tight.

	Avoid race condition when disposing of app
	When disposing of the VirtViewerApp, we free the hash table
	containing the windows. This causes each window to be freed,
	which in turn causes the visibility callback to be invoked.
	This can then get NULL pointers from the self->priv->windows
	usage.

	Blank out priv->windows before unrefing the hashs and add
	a check to ensure priv->windows is non-NULL.

2012-05-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ensure windows are destroyed when display closes
	When running virt-viewer with the --reconnect argument, when
	the session closes, the VirtViewerWindow instances were being

	Fix automatic usb redir through controller
	remote-viewer is currently trying to use
	SpiceUsbDeviceManager::auto-connect to control whether USB devices
	should be automatically connected or not. However, this property
	is more or less an internal spice-gtk property which is toggled
	by SpiceGtkSession when the SPICE widget gets/loses focus.

	SpiceGtkSession has an "auto-usbredir" property which can be used
	by applications to enable/disable automatic usb redirection through
	SPICE. Since this property is helpfully bound to
	VirtViewerSession::auto-usbredir, use this when the controller
	is told to enable/disable USB redirection.

	Without this change, automatic USB redirection will always get reenabled
	as soon as there's a focus change since SpiceGtkSession::auto-usbredir
	defaults to be enabled in spice-gtk.

2012-04-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix typo in variable names for Win32 command helper

	Fix close of VNC displays
	When clicking the close button on a virt-viewer window with
	a VNC session open, while the VNC session terminates, the
	window does not go away.

	The problem is that the virt_viewer_session_vnc_disconnected
	method never gets invoked. The close button triggers a call
	to virt_viewer_session_clear_displays which unrefs the
	VirtViewerDisplayVnc instance. This in turn triggers a call
	to gtk_container_destroy, which destroys all widgets it
	contains, ie the VncDisplay * object.

	With the VncDisplay object in its dispose phase, no signals
	will ever be emitted, thus the 'vnc-disconnected' signal
	never gets seen.

	The design issue is that VirtViewerDisplayVnc is assuming
	it owns the VncDisplay, whereas in fact the real owner is
	the VirtViewerSessionVnc object.

	The solution is to introduce a new virt_viewer_display_close
	method which can be used to de-parent the widget before
	VirtViewerDisplay is unref'd.

	The VirtViewerSessionVnc object also needs to hold a full ref
	on the VncDisplay object, not merely a floating reference

	* virt-viewer-display-spice.c, virt-viewer-display.c,
	  virt-viewer-display.h: Add virt_viewer_display_close

	virt-viewer-window: Add a USB device selection to the fullscreen menu (v2)
	Note this button only gets shown on USB redir capable virtual machines.

	Changes in v2:
	-Use gtk_widget_set_visible for simpler code

	window: Call virt_viewer_app_quit instead of gtk_main_quit
	When quiting from the fullscreen menu call virt_viewer_app_quit instead of
	gtk_main_quit so that the session gets properly disconnected before quiting.

	virt_viewer_app_quit: Cleanly close the connection before quiting
	Even though the previous patches in this series ensure that the session
	gets properly finalized, we still need to wait for the disconnect signal,
	as spice-glib uses co-routines which need some time to cleanly close the
	connection / session.

	session-spice: Delay the disconnected signal till all channels are closed
	Before this patch session-spice would emit the disconnected signal as soon
	as the main channel is closed, but other channels may still be open at
	that time and raising the disconnected signal usally leads to the app class
	calling gtk_main_quit, at which point the other channels never get properly
	finalized (as there co-routines still hold a reference to them).

	This is esp. bad for usbredir channels as these re-attach the kernel driver
	for redirected devices when finalized. So exiting without properly finalizing
	them leads to the formerly redirected devices not being usuable until the
	driver is manually reloaded or the device is unplugged and re-plugged
	(the kernel does not automatically re-bind kernel drivers when userspace
	 closes a usbfs node).

	This patch fixes this by delaying the emitting of the disconnect signal
	until the last channel has been destroyed.

	virt-viewer-app: unref the session on dispose
	With this patch combined with the previous patches in this series, the
	VirtViewerSession (finally) gets properly finalized on exit.

	virt-viewer-display: Use a borrowed reference to session
	Before this patch there was a cyclic reference between VirtViewerSesion and
	VirtViewerDisplay, since all VirtViewerDisplays are created / destroyed by
	VirtViewerSession it is safe to assume that lifetime of VirtViewerSession >=
	VirtViewerDisplay, so VirtViewerDisplay can take a borrowed reference
	breaking the circle, and allowing proper cleanup on exit.

	Note that there is no g_object_unref removed from virt-viewer-display, this
	because there is no finalize / dispose and before this patch
	VirtViewerDisplay never unref-ed the reference it hold to the session.

	virt-viewer-window: Use a borrowed reference to app
	Before this patch there was a cyclic reference between VirtViewerApp and
	VirtViewerWindow, since all VirtViewerWindows are created / destroyed by
	VirtViewerApp it is safe to assume that lifetime of VirtViewerApp >=
	VirtViewerWindow, so VirtViewerWindow can take a borrowed reference
	breaking the circle, and allowing proper cleanup on exit.

	virt-viewer-app: main_window is part of our windows hashtable
	This means that:
	1) There is no need to explictly set its title separately
	2) It is unref-ed when we do g_hash_table_unref(priv->windows), so it
	   should not be unref-ed separately otherwise it is unref-ed twice!

	Notice that 2 was never a problem because of circular references
	between VirtViewerApp and VirtViewerWindow, but once the follow
	up patch to this one breaks the circle 2 becomes an issue.

	session-spice: dispose should chain up to dispose not finalize!!

	usbredir: Gnome HIG-ify USB device selection dialog
	These changes match the changes already made to the spice-gtk
	usb device selection widget to match the spacing advised by the Gnome HIG.

	usbredir: Shrink the usb device selection dialog when devices are unplugged

2012-03-05  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Don't attempt to translate ""
	The empty string has a magic meaning for gettext, it's used to

	change to _("") to "" when we want an empty string.

	spice: fix connecting via ssh to a password-protected server
	spice_session_connect() will attempt to connect directly to the
	server, we need to continue calling spice_session_open_fd() for ssh
	tunnel to work.

	spice: fix double unref of main channel
	When doing unref() on a channel, channel-destroy signal may be emitted
	during object dispose time, and it will attempt to unref() the channel
	again likely leading to a crash.

	It may be that spice-gtk should have a different/simpler object
	life-cycle model, but it's also a good assumption to not take strong
	references on the channels, but just keep a weak reference as the
	session is really the channel life-cycle manager.

	Make the password field activates default widget
	When pressing "Enter", the default auth dialog action isn't activated.
	Setting activates_default to TRUE fixes this issue.

	Do not resize guest desktop if !auto-resize
	If auto-resize is enabled, the guest desktop size will be resized to
	match current window*zoom size.

	This can be a problem if the user explicitely set the desktop size to
	a different resolution and want to keep it. Disabling auto-resize
	sounds like a simple way to allow that.

	Resize Spice guest display to the container size
	The SpiceDisplay doesn't receive the full allocation, because
	VirtViewerDisplay maintains current aspect ratio. However, the guest
	display can be resize up to its container size.

	This fixes going full-screen and not getting native resolution for
	instance.

	Import a pretty icon for virt-viewer application

	Re-added GtkBuilder XML files to POTFILES.in
	Adapt syntax-check  rule to allow XML files in POTFILES.in and
	re-add the GtkBuilder XML files

	Implement SPICE desktop resizing that takes account of zoom level
	The standard SPICE widget guest resize implementation does not
	take into account the zoom level settings in virt-viewer, because
	it has no knowledge of this functionality. The guest resize can,
	however, be done by calling spice_main_set_display() directly.
	This allows virt-viewer to resize the guest taking into account
	zoom levels.

	 ie, if virt-viewer is run with --zoom 50 and the window
	     is resized to 400x300, then the guest agent should
	     be told to set its resolution to 800x600

2012-02-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Revert support for resizing guest desktop
	The SpiceDisplay widget has built-in support for resizing the
	guest desktop, but this does not know that virt-viewer has a
	zoom level setting. This makes the virt-viewer zoom completely
	inoperable. Revert use of the 'resize-guest' property.

	build: use AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	Using intltool macro only causes build issues on exotic platforms,

	As long as this bug isn't fixed, we should use AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/intltool/+bug/398571

	NB this partially reverts

	  3473c4bb49adc0caca58dc1a8b6ce81c6870558a

	The difference is the ordering of the rules. With AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	appearing after IT_PROG_INTLTOOL, the --disable-nls arg to configure
	is broken. Thus AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT is called first in this change.

2011-07-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove duplicated struct definition

2011-07-26  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	If only one display, fullscreen should be on the current display

	Show status on all open windows
	The split virt_viewer_notebook_show_status() to
	virt_viewer_notebook_show_status_va() is unnecessary
	in the end, but it's more future-proof.

	Add a "Displays" submenu, and warn when closing last display

	Don't ignore creation of secondary displays

	Use app fullscreen property instead of app.start() argument

	Implement app_set_fullscreen() to go over existing windows

	Show display and rise its window when we have the display show hint
	Track event for Spice, and imitate it for VNC.

	Change enter/leave fullscreen to take/restore position
	That allow positionning windows in multi-head.

	Also, get rid of window_state_cb, since it's impossible to
	properly catch the event to do the right thing, ie move to a different
	screen before go full-screen, or disallow it in case nb physical
	monitors < nb virtual monitors.

	Add nth window to virt_viewer_app_window_new()

	Introduce fullscreen property and virt_viewer_app_set_fullscreen()

	Let virt_viewer_notebook_show_status take varags

	Status messages can be translated

	Add show-hint property to display

	Split VirtViewerApp window into VirtViewerWindow

2011-07-22  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Inherit from VirtViewerApp for VirtViewer
	Make it a real GObject.

	The parts specific to virt should go in virt-viewer.c

	Turn VirtViewer into a VirtViewerApp object

	Split virt_viewer_start() and virt_viewer_new()

	Split virt_viewer_activate() and virt_viewer_set_domain()

	Split virt_viewer_create_session() out of virt_viewer_extract_connect_info()
	For future reusability

	Reorder _VirtViewer to make it easier to split with RemoteViewer

	Extract scheme in virt_viewer_extract_host()
	Needed for remote-viewer.

2011-07-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove use of AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	Since we already invoke the intltool macros, also invoking
	AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT is wrong and causes problems with the
	later makefile rules

2011-07-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix build requirements for GTK3

	Remove bogus hardcoded check for GTK2

	Disable SPICE unless on x86 architectures

	Fix compat with GTK 2.18.0

	Updates for 0.4.0 release

	Remove virt-viewer-priv.h from sources, since it is gone

	Remove duplicated typedefs

	Annotate unused variables

	Fix leak of graphics type attribute from XML

	Fix leak of command line arguments

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Split pull part of VirtViewerDisplay out into VirtViewerSession
	To facilitate introduction of multi-head support, pull some of
	the VirtViewerDisplay class out into a new VirtViewerSession
	class.

	Avoid (null) in titlebar

	Fix colour of status label to show up on black background

	Fix reconnecting of SPICE display

2011-07-11  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Fill space on the display alignment with black

	Add support for --fullscreen option

	Skip non-primary monitors in SPICE

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove circular dependancy between VirtViewerDisplay and VirtViewer
	Add many signals to VirtViewerDisplay which are emitted when various
	events occur. This lets us remove all the code in the VirtViewerDisplay
	subclasses which call back into VirtViewer methods. Instead VirtViewer
	can simply connect signals to the display

	Turn VirtViewerDisplay into a proper Gtk widget
	Turn VirtViewerDisplay into a Gtk widget instead of just a GObject,
	by merging the functionality from VirtViewerAlign

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Update to optionally build with GTK3

2011-07-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Replace use of GtkAlignment with a custom align widget
	To use the GtkAlignment we have to play evil tricks overriding
	its size request, to make it reallocate the child to the preferred
	size we desire based on the virtual desktop size + zoom level.

	By replacing the GtkAlignment with a custom widget we can
	directly implement the layout/sizing semantics we want without
	playing stupid games

	Introduce standard naming convention to files & methods
	All source files must be named

	  virt-viewer-XXXX

	All methods named

	  virt_viewer_XXX

2011-07-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix some compile warnings

	Convert from Glade to GtkBuilder

	Refactor configure.ac to pull out required version

	Enable use of scaling from spice >= 0.6
	Make the SPICE widget operate in the same way as the VNC widget
	with display scaling, and auto-resize, but preserving guest
	aspect ratio

	Hide menu bar on fullscreen & add a hiding toolbar
	* src/Makefile.am, src/view/autoDrawer.c, src/view/autoDrawer.c
	  src/view/drawer.c, src/view/drawer.h, src/view/ovBox.c,
	  src/view/ovBox.c: Import auto-drawer from vinagre
	* src/viewer-priv.h, src/viewer.c, src/viewer.glade,
	  src/display-vnc.c: Insert an auto-drawer above the
	  notebook and display an auto-hiding toolbar when fullscreen

2011-06-30  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add message about whether it is VNC or SPICE display

	Add some useful data for the --verbose flag

2011-05-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix re-connect after authentication failure
	viewer->display will be non-NULL if we have already attempted a
	connection. So, remove the check for it being NULL, and instead
	skip the widget setup step.

2011-05-23  Jiri Denemark  <Jiri.Denemark@gmail.com>

	Add support for listen attribute
	Virt-viewer now parses listen attribute from graphics element to be able
	to connect to domains configured with explicit listen address:

	    <graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' listen='123.45.67.89'/>

2011-05-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Replace .hgignore with .gitignore

2011-02-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>
