	Avoid use of deprecated GTK3 pointer APIs
	The gtk_widget_get_pointer() API is deprecated in GTK3 since it
	is not aware of multiple pointers. Replace its usage in autoDrawer.c
	with GdkDeviceManager and friends

	Adapt to avoid use of deprecated GTK3 style & size APIs
	The GtkStyle API has been deprecated in favour of GtkStyleContext.
	Update ovBox.c to use the latter if building with GtK3. Also replace
	use of the gtk_widget_size_request API with gtk_widget_get_preferred_size.

	Avoid race condition when disposing of app
	When disposing of the VirtViewerApp, we free the hash table
	containing the windows. This causes each window to be freed,
	which in turn causes the visibility callback to be invoked.
	This can then get NULL pointers from the self->priv->windows
	usage.

	Blank out priv->windows before unrefing the hashs and add
	a check to ensure priv->windows is non-NULL.

2012-05-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ensure windows are destroyed when display closes
	When running virt-viewer with the --reconnect argument, when
	the session closes, the VirtViewerWindow instances were being
	freed, but not the GtkWindow itself. So the orphaned window
	stayed around doing nothing. The GtkBuilder instance was also
	leaked.

	Fix these two leaks & also add some debugging to help future
	troubleshooting

2012-04-17  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix automatic usb redir through controller
	remote-viewer is currently trying to use
	SpiceUsbDeviceManager::auto-connect to control whether USB devices
	should be automatically connected or not. However, this property
	is more or less an internal spice-gtk property which is toggled
	by SpiceGtkSession when the SPICE widget gets/loses focus.

	SpiceGtkSession has an "auto-usbredir" property which can be used
	by applications to enable/disable automatic usb redirection through
	SPICE. Since this property is helpfully bound to
	VirtViewerSession::auto-usbredir, use this when the controller
	is told to enable/disable USB redirection.

	Without this change, automatic USB redirection will always get reenabled
	as soon as there's a focus change since SpiceGtkSession::auto-usbredir
	defaults to be enabled in spice-gtk.

	Minor simplification/optimization of VirtViewerDisplay

2012-04-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix typo in variable names for Win32 command helper

	Fix close of VNC displays
	When clicking the close button on a virt-viewer window with
	a VNC session open, while the VNC session terminates, the
	window does not go away.

	The problem is that the virt_viewer_session_vnc_disconnected
	method never gets invoked. The close button triggers a call
	to virt_viewer_session_clear_displays which unrefs the
	VirtViewerDisplayVnc instance. This in turn triggers a call
	to gtk_container_destroy, which destroys all widgets it
	contains, ie the VncDisplay * object.

	With the VncDisplay object in its dispose phase, no signals
	will ever be emitted, thus the 'vnc-disconnected' signal
	never gets seen.

	The design issue is that VirtViewerDisplayVnc is assuming
	it owns the VncDisplay, whereas in fact the real owner is
	the VirtViewerSessionVnc object.

	The solution is to introduce a new virt_viewer_display_close
	method which can be used to de-parent the widget before
	VirtViewerDisplay is unref'd.

	The VirtViewerSessionVnc object also needs to hold a full ref
	on the VncDisplay object, not merely a floating reference

	* virt-viewer-display-spice.c, virt-viewer-display.c,
	  virt-viewer-display.h: Add virt_viewer_display_close
	* virt-viewer-display-vnc.c: Deparent VNC widget in
	  virt_viewer_display_close impl
	* virt-viewer-session-vnc.c: Improve logging
	* virt-viewer-session.c: Call virt_viewer_display_close
	  before unrefing display
	* virt-viewer-window.c: Improve logging

	Notify focus state when the foreign menu title is set
	The current code only inform of focus state when the listener is ready.
	spice-gtk controller code lacks signal when a client connects, but a

	virt-viewer-window: Add a USB device selection to the fullscreen menu (v2)
	Note this button only gets shown on USB redir capable virtual machines.

	Changes in v2:
	-Use gtk_widget_set_visible for simpler code

	window: Call virt_viewer_app_quit instead of gtk_main_quit
	When quiting from the fullscreen menu call virt_viewer_app_quit instead of
	gtk_main_quit so that the session gets properly disconnected before quiting.

	virt_viewer_app_quit: Cleanly close the connection before quiting
	Even though the previous patches in this series ensure that the session
	gets properly finalized, we still need to wait for the disconnect signal,
	as spice-glib uses co-routines which need some time to cleanly close the
	connection / session.

	session-spice: Delay the disconnected signal till all channels are closed
	Before this patch session-spice would emit the disconnected signal as soon
	as the main channel is closed, but other channels may still be open at
	that time and raising the disconnected signal usally leads to the app class
	calling gtk_main_quit, at which point the other channels never get properly
	finalized (as there co-routines still hold a reference to them).

	This is esp. bad for usbredir channels as these re-attach the kernel driver
	for redirected devices when finalized. So exiting without properly finalizing
	them leads to the formerly redirected devices not being usuable until the
	driver is manually reloaded or the device is unplugged and re-plugged
	(the kernel does not automatically re-bind kernel drivers when userspace
	 closes a usbfs node).

	This patch fixes this by delaying the emitting of the disconnect signal
	until the last channel has been destroyed.

	virt-viewer-app: unref the session on dispose
	With this patch combined with the previous patches in this series, the
	VirtViewerSession (finally) gets properly finalized on exit.

	virt-viewer-display: Use a borrowed reference to session
	Before this patch there was a cyclic reference between VirtViewerSesion and
	VirtViewerDisplay, since all VirtViewerDisplays are created / destroyed by
	VirtViewerSession it is safe to assume that lifetime of VirtViewerSession >=
	VirtViewerDisplay, so VirtViewerDisplay can take a borrowed reference
	breaking the circle, and allowing proper cleanup on exit.

	Note that there is no g_object_unref removed from virt-viewer-display, this
	because there is no finalize / dispose and before this patch
	VirtViewerDisplay never unref-ed the reference it hold to the session.

	virt-viewer-window: Use a borrowed reference to app
	Before this patch there was a cyclic reference between VirtViewerApp and
	VirtViewerWindow, since all VirtViewerWindows are created / destroyed by
	VirtViewerApp it is safe to assume that lifetime of VirtViewerApp >=
	VirtViewerWindow, so VirtViewerWindow can take a borrowed reference
	breaking the circle, and allowing proper cleanup on exit.

	virt-viewer-app: main_window is part of our windows hashtable
	This means that:
	1) There is no need to explictly set its title separately
	2) It is unref-ed when we do g_hash_table_unref(priv->windows), so it
	   should not be unref-ed separately otherwise it is unref-ed twice!

	Notice that 2 was never a problem because of circular references
	between VirtViewerApp and VirtViewerWindow, but once the follow
	up patch to this one breaks the circle 2 becomes an issue.

	session-spice: dispose should chain up to dispose not finalize!!

	usbredir: Gnome HIG-ify USB device selection dialog
	These changes match the changes already made to the spice-gtk
	usb device selection widget to match the spacing advised by the Gnome HIG.

	usbredir: Shrink the usb device selection dialog when devices are unplugged

	change to _("") to "" when we want an empty string.

	spice: fix connecting via ssh to a password-protected server
	spice_session_connect() will attempt to connect directly to the

	tunnel to work.

	spice: fix double unref of main channel
	When doing unref() on a channel, channel-destroy signal may be emitted
	during object dispose time, and it will attempt to unref() the channel
	again likely leading to a crash.

	It may be that spice-gtk should have a different/simpler object
	life-cycle model, but it's also a good assumption to not take strong
	references on the channels, but just keep a weak reference as the
	session is really the channel life-cycle manager.

	Do not resize guest desktop if !auto-resize
	If auto-resize is enabled, the guest desktop size will be resized to

	This can be a problem if the user explicitely set the desktop size to
	a different resolution and want to keep it. Disabling auto-resize
	sounds like a simple way to allow that.

	Resize Spice guest display to the container size
	The SpiceDisplay doesn't receive the full allocation, because
	VirtViewerDisplay maintains current aspect ratio. However, the guest
	display can be resize up to its container size.

	This fixes going full-screen and not getting native resolution for
	instance.

	Implement SPICE desktop resizing that takes account of zoom level
	The standard SPICE widget guest resize implementation does not
	take into account the zoom level settings in virt-viewer, because
	it has no knowledge of this functionality. The guest resize can,
	however, be done by calling spice_main_set_display() directly.
	This allows virt-viewer to resize the guest taking into account
	zoom levels.

	 ie, if virt-viewer is run with --zoom 50 and the window
	     is resized to 400x300, then the guest agent should
	     be told to set its resolution to 800x600

2012-02-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Revert support for resizing guest desktop
	The SpiceDisplay widget has built-in support for resizing the

	Override the grab_focus() method in the display class. Since both VNC
	and Spice displays are the direct child, let's just grab the child.
	It can be that this behaviour need to be overriden if Spice or VNC
	display become more complex (using sub-childs or different objects)

2012-01-31  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ignore more generated files

2012-01-31  Guannan Ren  <gren@redhat.com>

	Disconnect virt-viewer when receiving signal session-cancelled

	Register a new signal session-cancelled

	Tune the first argument in calls to g_type_class_add_private()

2012-01-31  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Support for virDomainOpenGraphics API
	Add a new flag --attach, which instructs virt-viewer to attach
	to the target display using virDomainOpenGraphics, instead of
	initiating a VNC/SPICE connection directly.

	Make VNC support opening connections based on URI

	Adapt remote-viewer so that it builds without SPICE

2012-01-31  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Add virt-viewer.nsis
	Use ${DESTDIR} variable and @prefix@ to look for files.
	Can't easily be generated, it has too much customization.

2012-01-31  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	Enable spice auto-usbredir

	Remove usage of deprecated property

	Add error dialog for USB redirection failure

	Resize guest desktop with SPICE
	This is the method we prefer, even though we can't keep aspect ratio.
	We could eventually support aspect ration in spice-gtk.

2012-01-31  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	build: make libvirt optionnal

2012-01-31  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	Use a first letter capital in help
	The GLib/GNOME convention seems to have first letter as capital for
	option description strings.

2012-01-31  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Add spice_get_option_group()

	Add spice controller support in remote-viewer
	Usage is simply "remote-viewer --spice-controller"

	Add remote-viewer program
	This program is meant for direct URI connections.
	ex: remote-viewer vnc://uri

2012-01-30  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	Add a few property getters, used by controller
	- virt_viewer_app_get_windows()
	- virt_viewer_window_get_builder()
	- "VirtViewerSessionSpice:spice-session" property

	build: use AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	Using intltool macro only causes build issues on exotic platforms,
	such as MinGW.

	As long as this bug isn't fixed, we should use AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/intltool/+bug/398571

	NB this partially reverts

	  3473c4bb49adc0caca58dc1a8b6ce81c6870558a

	The difference is the ordering of the rules. With AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	appearing after IT_PROG_INTLTOOL, the --disable-nls arg to configure
	is broken. Thus AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT is called first in this change.

2012-01-30  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Make virt_viewer_activate() a vfunc
	since other equivalent methods are already overridable.

	Add window-added & window-removed signals

	Use graphical URI for connection
	If specified, use URI for connection details

	Add virt_viewer_session_open_uri

	build: replace deprecated functions

2012-01-30  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add support for --system arg to autogen.sh

2011-11-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

2011-11-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Require GTK-VNC 0.4.3 and remove redundant realize() call
	Remove call to gtk_widget_realize for the GTK-VNC widget. Requires
	GTK-VNC >= 0.4.3

2011-11-07  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Emit display-desktop-resize from set_desktop_size()

2011-11-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't include INSTALL file in GIT

	Revert 1a56de3acad6a19fd958fae9278cf1c97fdabb18
	The GLIB2 check previously removed was misleading because it in
	fact checked for gmodule-export-2.0 which is needed to export
	the signal handlers. Revert the previous commit, but rename the
	var to GMODULE2 to make it clearer

	Always use canonical URI from libvirt connection
	The URI we feed into libvirt may be an alias, so always query the
	actual URI used internally

2011-11-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update automated build to test both GTK2 and GTK3 builds

	Update mingw32 RPM specfile to use GTK3 on F15 or later

	Remove pkgconfig check for GLIB2 since it is implied by GTK2/3

2011-11-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix configure arg for disabling spice

	Print configuration summary

2011-10-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix broken keycombos for F9->F12 menu
	The table for sending C-A-Fn to guests had messed up mappings
	for F9->F12

	Wire up SpiceDisplay grab signals
	To ensure that we can put the key release sequence message in the
	title bar, wire up VirtViewerDisplaySpice to the grab signals
	in SpiceDisplay

	Fix setting of window title with --wait
	When waiting for a VM to appear or start, set the initial window
	title to the command line arg. When the VM actually appears then
	update it to the real VM name

2011-09-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix crash from previous commit when using UNIX sockets
	Code in the previous commit would use 'ghost' even when it was
	NULL, as with UNIX domain socket based connections.

2011-09-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix hostname when XML gives a wildcard address
	When the guest XML contains a wildcard address like 0.0.0.0 or ::,
	we can't directly use connect() on it. Instead we have to use the
	hostname/IP from the libvirt URI.

2011-09-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Propagate primary window zoom level to secondary windows
	Ensure that all windows get a default zoom level of 100. Propagate
	the primary window's zoom level to all secondary windows  when
	initially creating them

	Fix setting of window title with domain name

2011-08-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix setting of initial zoom level on display

2011-08-16  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	ff callbacks must be invoked from a clean stack
	If 'ff' callbacks are invoked directly from the remove
	callback they will likely deadlock in libvirt. They must
	be invoked from a clean stack, so switch to using a
	glib idle callback.

2011-08-14  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Don't print (null) as user

	Don't print incorrect port numbers
	The port isn't 22 when we connect to an alternate port given in
	.ssh/config.

	Don't hardcode ssh port to 0
	Many thanks to Luca Capello <luca@pca.it> for debugging this.

2011-08-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix inverted sshport test that broke SSH tunnelling

2011-08-04  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Return if xmlParseURI() failed, instead of crashing

	Lookup UI file correctly, to fix Windows support

	Mark exported function for gtkbuild to lookup on Windows

	Make title more translatable and using application name

	Use g_printerr for errors instead of fprintf(stderr,..)

	Lower severity of unhandled Spice events

2011-08-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update for 0.4.1 release

2011-08-03  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Don't hardcode SSH port to 22
	To allow $HOME/.ssh/config to override the default SSH port,
	don't hardcode '-p 22' in the command line.

2011-08-03  Pavel Raiskup  <praiskup@redhat.com>

	Remove unreachable condition in authentication dialog

2011-07-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove duplicated struct definition

2011-07-26  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	If only one display, fullscreen should be on the current display

	Show status on all open windows
	The split virt_viewer_notebook_show_status() to
	virt_viewer_notebook_show_status_va() is unnecessary
	in the end, but it's more future-proof.

	Add a "Displays" submenu, and warn when closing last display

	Don't ignore creation of secondary displays

	Use app fullscreen property instead of app.start() argument

	Implement app_set_fullscreen() to go over existing windows

	Show display and rise its window when we have the display show hint
	Track event for Spice, and imitate it for VNC.

	Change enter/leave fullscreen to take/restore position
	That allow positionning windows in multi-head.

	Also, get rid of window_state_cb, since it's impossible to
	properly catch the event to do the right thing, ie move to a different
	screen before go full-screen, or disallow it in case nb physical
	monitors < nb virtual monitors.

	Add nth window to virt_viewer_app_window_new()

	Introduce fullscreen property and virt_viewer_app_set_fullscreen()

	Let virt_viewer_notebook_show_status take varags

	Status messages can be translated

	Add show-hint property to display

	Split VirtViewerApp window into VirtViewerWindow

2011-07-22  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Inherit from VirtViewerApp for VirtViewer
	Make it a real GObject.

	The parts specific to virt should go in virt-viewer.c

	Turn VirtViewer into a VirtViewerApp object

	Split virt_viewer_start() and virt_viewer_new()

	Split virt_viewer_activate() and virt_viewer_set_domain()

	Split virt_viewer_create_session() out of virt_viewer_extract_connect_info()
	For future reusability

	Reorder _VirtViewer to make it easier to split with RemoteViewer

	Extract scheme in virt_viewer_extract_host()
	Needed for remote-viewer.

2011-07-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove use of AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	Since we already invoke the intltool macros, also invoking
	AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT is wrong and causes problems with the
	later makefile rules

2011-07-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix build requirements for GTK3

	Remove bogus hardcoded check for GTK2

	Disable SPICE unless on x86 architectures

	Fix compat with GTK 2.18.0

	Updates for 0.4.0 release

	Remove virt-viewer-priv.h from sources, since it is gone

	Annotate unused variables

	Fix leak of graphics type attribute from XML

	Fix leak of command line arguments

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Split pull part of VirtViewerDisplay out into VirtViewerSession
	To facilitate introduction of multi-head support, pull some of
	the VirtViewerDisplay class out into a new VirtViewerSession
	class.

	Avoid (null) in titlebar

	Fix colour of status label to show up on black background

	Fix reconnecting of SPICE display

2011-07-11  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Fill space on the display alignment with black

	Add support for --fullscreen option

	Skip non-primary monitors in SPICE

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove circular dependancy between VirtViewerDisplay and VirtViewer
	Add many signals to VirtViewerDisplay which are emitted when various
	events occur. This lets us remove all the code in the VirtViewerDisplay
	subclasses which call back into VirtViewer methods. Instead VirtViewer
	can simply connect signals to the display

	Turn VirtViewerDisplay into a proper Gtk widget
	Turn VirtViewerDisplay into a Gtk widget instead of just a GObject,
	by merging the functionality from VirtViewerAlign

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Update to optionally build with GTK3

2011-07-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Replace use of GtkAlignment with a custom align widget
	To use the GtkAlignment we have to play evil tricks overriding
	its size request, to make it reallocate the child to the preferred
	size we desire based on the virtual desktop size + zoom level.

	By replacing the GtkAlignment with a custom widget we can
	directly implement the layout/sizing semantics we want without
	playing stupid games

	Introduce standard naming convention to files & methods
	All source files must be named

	  virt-viewer-XXXX

	All methods named

	  virt_viewer_XXX

2011-07-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix some compile warnings

	Convert from Glade to GtkBuilder

	Refactor configure.ac to pull out required version

	Enable use of scaling from spice >= 0.6
	Make the SPICE widget operate in the same way as the VNC widget
	with display scaling, and auto-resize, but preserving guest
	aspect ratio

	Hide menu bar on fullscreen & add a hiding toolbar
	* src/Makefile.am, src/view/autoDrawer.c, src/view/autoDrawer.c
	  src/view/drawer.c, src/view/drawer.h, src/view/ovBox.c,
	  src/view/ovBox.c: Import auto-drawer from vinagre
	* src/viewer-priv.h, src/viewer.c, src/viewer.glade,
	  src/display-vnc.c: Insert an auto-drawer above the
	  notebook and display an auto-hiding toolbar when fullscreen

2011-06-30  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add message about whether it is VNC or SPICE display

	Add some useful data for the --verbose flag

2011-05-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix re-connect after authentication failure
	viewer->display will be non-NULL if we have already attempted a
	connection. So, remove the check for it being NULL, and instead
	skip the widget setup step.

2011-05-23  Jiri Denemark  <Jiri.Denemark@gmail.com>

	Add support for listen attribute
	Virt-viewer now parses listen attribute from graphics element to be able
	to connect to domains configured with explicit listen address:

	    <graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' listen='123.45.67.89'/>

2011-05-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
