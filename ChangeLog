	Use GOptionGroup for VirtViewerApp options
	Encapsulate things a bit better by adding
	virt_viewer_app_get_option_group() which provides a GOptionGroup rather
	than exposing an array of options.  This option is then set as the main
	option group, and additional options can be added by subclasses, so the
	effect to the user should be equivalent.

	corresponding output
	automake: object file(s) will be placed in the top-level directory.
	However,
	automake: this behaviour will change in future Automake versions: they
	will

	Don't use C99 for loops
	Declaring a local variable as part as a for loop
	such as 'for (unsigned int i; i < N; i++)' is a C99 specific feature.
	Running configure with --enable-compile-warnings=minimal does not add
	-std=c99 to the compile flags, so it's better if the codebase does not
	require C99 support from the compiler.

	rhbz#1111514: Fix un-shrinkable displays on windows guests
	Commit 6edde5786 introduced a regression wrt shrinking windows on windows
	guests. This seems to be because resizing a display often causes the notebook
	widget to switch to the status page temporarily (often so quickly that it's not
	noticeable to the eye). This causes a quick 'unmap' and 'map' event sequence on
	the display widget. Apparently the timing of these events varies enough between
	linux and windows guests that it is only noticeable on windows gueststhe timing
	of these events varies enough between linux and windows guests that it is only
	noticeable on windows guests. The exact sequence that causes the bug appears to
	be as follows:

	1 user resizes window smaller
	2 display widget gets a new allocation, which causes it to send a display
	  reconfiguration to the guest
	3 client receives a new show-hint for the display which causes it to switch
	  temporarily to the 'status' notebook page
	4 display widget gets unmapped
	5 Client receives another new show-hint, which causes the display widget to get
	  re- mapped, which causes client to send a display reconfiguration to the guest
	  (using the old size)
	6 client receives new (smaller, from step 2) display size and temporarily
	  changes to the new size
	7 client receives new (larger, from step 5) display size and changes back to
	  original size.

	To fix the issue, we only explicitly request a resize in response to the very
	first map event, and for any subsequent map events, we simply call
	_make_resizable() as before.

	Bump version 1.0 to simplify Windows MSI versioning
	The Windows MSI product version is restricted to a 3 component
	version number, whose fields are a max value of 255.255.65536

	Since the main virt-viewer version takes up 3 components already,
	we have the munge the micro version together with the first
	component of the release version. eg we have

	   $VERSION[0].$VERSION[1].($VERSION[2] << 8 + $RELEASE[0])

	This causes problems for RHEL which needs to have 2-component
	release versions to deal with z-stream builds.  eg a RHEL
	version might be virt-viewer-0.5.6-2.el6_4.3 and we've
	no easy way of adding the final '.3' to the Windows product
	version.

	If we reduce the primary virt-viewer version to just 2 components,
	then we can leave the 3rd component for exclusive use by the RPM
	release number. eg so we'd make product version up using

	   $VERSION[0].$VERSION[1].($RELEASE[0] << 8 + $RELEASE[1])

	In course of normal development, we'd increase the $VERSION[0]
	for each release. ie next release is 1.0, then 2.0, then 3.0.
	This means we retain the ability to put out "stable" branch
	releases for any historical version by doing 1.1, 1.2 instead
	of having to re-add a 3rd component.

	Fix tiny window when resetting zoom factor in gtk2 build
	rhbz#1104064 had a couple of symptoms. The first was fixed in
	6edde57862ac30e74ce6412c93a2fa925ae4ea67.

	The second symptom is that displays could also become tiny when clicking 'View >
	Zoom > Normal Size'. This was because VirtViewerDisplay returned early from
	_display_set_zoom_level() if the zoom level was being set to the current zoom
	setting. However, the calling function (_window_set_zoom_level()) also tries to
	queue a resize event for itself after setting the zoom level on the display. If
	the display doesn't queue a resize event for itself, its size request will only
	be 50x50 during the window resize negotiation. This causes the display to become
	tiny and zoomed out. Queueing a resize on the display widget ensures that it
	will request the proper size during the next allocation.

	Fix tiny windows for secondary displays in gtk2 build
	When enabling a new display on linux guests, the new window would be tiny
	(50x50) and zoomed way out. This was caused by the fact that when the display
	widget received the 'map' event, it unconditionally cleared the 'dirty' flag,
	which meant that it would only request 50x50 size. This behavior was intended to
	fix a bug on the windows client which wprevented windows from resized smaller
	than the guest display resolution. Unfortunately, due to the timing of the 'map'
	and allocate events, the widget became very small.

	Instead of clearing the 'dirty' flag directly when a widget is mapped, we
	now queue a resize event, which will guarantee that the widget attains its
	desired size and will then clear its dirty flag (allowing it to be resized).
	Testing on windows indicates that this fix still solves the 'unshrinkable
	window' problem while also preventing the tiny secondary display bug.

	Don't connect to localhost when using --direct
	Trying to connect to a remote virtual machine using
	virt-viewer -c qemu+ssh://example.com/system --direct $vm_name
	will currently fail with an error message saying it's not possible to
	localhost. This happens with VMs which listen on a wildcard address (eg
	'0.0.0.0').
	This was introduced by commit 74b1b62 which changes the host to connect to
	to 'localhost' when trying to connect through ssh to a VM listening on a
	wildcard address. This is only valid when using a ssh tunnel, and should
	not be done with --direct. The fallback code which uses the hostname from
	the libvirt URI is what makes the most sense in this situation (wildcard
	listen address + --direct).
	This commit introduces a virt_viewer_app_get_direct() so that this can be
	implemented.

	build-sys: Always prepend '-' to build id
	When using the --with-buildid configure paramater, the build id which is

	the build id which is used in the C files does not get this '-'
	automatically.

	Currently, the linux and mingw spec files prepend a '-' on their own to the
	--with-buildid argument, but this causes the MSI installer to show 2 '-'
	during installation: "Please wait while Windows configures VirtViewer
	0.6.0--1"

	This commit always prepends a '-' to the buildid strings, and removes the
	'-' from the spec files. This is to ensure the separator between version

	Fix regression with enabling additional displays
	Commit 8fa942 broke enabling of additional displays. We don't want to send down
	display re-configurations due to events that happen while setting up windows for
	enabled displays that we recieve from the server. However, by ignoring
	allocations on unmapped windows, we fail to send display configurations for new
	displays that a user is attempting to enable via the window menu. To
	discriminate between these two cases, we check whether the display is in the
	'ready' state or not.
	- Unmapped displays with the 'ready' hint set can be assumed to be displays
	  that are enabled on the server that we are attempting to create windows for on
	  the client. In this case, we should *not* send a display configuration to the
	  server
	- Unmapped displays with the 'ready' hint cleared can be assumed to be displays
	  that are not yet enabled on the server that we are trying to enable in the
	  client. In this case, we *should* send a display configuration to the server

	In some situation, (for example, guest without vdagent running), it's
	possible to pass key combinations to virt-viewer. When using alt+f4,

	Fix broken 'release-cursor' accel when not specified in --hotkeys
	When the --hotkeys option is given, all hotkeys that are not explicitly
	specified are disabled.  The method used to disable hotkeys is to change the
	accel map entry to key=0, mods=0. However, when we decide whether to set a grab
	sequence on the spice dispay widget, we simply use the return value for
	gtk_accel_map_lookup_entry and assume that a TRUE value returned from this
	function means that the hotkey is enabled.  In reality, this function will
	return TRUE for disabled hotkeys, but the 'key' variable will be set to key=0,
	mods=0. The result is that if I start virt-viewer like this:

	    virt-viewer --hotkeys secure-attention=ctrl+alt+end ...

	and the guest that I'm attached to uses server mouse mode, it will be impossible
	to release the grab on the spice widget.  Because we will explicitly disable the
	grab keys in the spice widget and handle the 'release-cursor' hotkey in
	virt-viewer, but the hotkey is an empty accel key.

	Instead of simply checking the return value of gtk_accel_map_lookup_entry, we
	have to inspect the return value for 'key' and check whether any keys are
	actually assigned.

	Don't create new windows at startup when kiosk mode is false
	virt_viewer_app_set_kiosk creates a new window at startup for each client
	monitor (regardless of whether the guest supports more than one display).  This
	seems unnecessary.  Only do this if kiosk mode is actually enabled.

	Remove special-case for getting window n=0
	virt_viewer_app_get_nth_window() will return the proper window when passed 0 for
	the 'nth' argument, so there's no need to avoid calling it in this case.  It
	just complicates the code logic.

	Don't resize guest display on zoom change
	When the zoom level is changed, the virt-viewer window gets resized. But we
	don't want this to trigger a resize of the guest display. But occasionally
	rounding errors cause the guest display to be reconfigured when zooming out.  To
	fix this, we first check whether the current size is the preferred size.  If it
	is, we don't send down a resize command to the guest.

	In addition to preventing guest resizes in response to zooming, it also improves
	the behavior when the guest display resolution is changed from within the guest.
	Before this change, we'd have the following behavior:
	    A. guest changes display to WxH
	    B. client gets notified of change and resizes the window to WxH
	    C. client responds to window resize by sending a new monitor config command to the guest

	With this change, the extra step C will be avoided because we're already at the
	preferred size.

	rhbz#1007306 - Don't free session if we're re-trying auth
	deactivate() is called in response to a failed authentication attempt. If the
	session is cleared here, when a user attempts to re-authenticate, it will issue
	a warning and will not actually work. So only clear the session here if we're
	not going to re-try authentication.

	Don't set VNC display to ready until vnc is initialized
	We were setting the show_hint to READY as soon as we got the vnc-connected
	signal.  But there may be an authentication step between vnc-connected and
	vnc-initialized.  In this case, we switch to an empty black display during the
	authentication step instead of showing the 'waiting for display N' status.

	Don't hide the main window when disconnecting
	The main window (display #1) is treated a bit differently from other windows,
	since it is opened at app start and displays status messages while we attempt to
	connect to the remote guest.  As such, it should really stay open as long as the
	app is running.

	The impetus for this change is the following:
	- user attempts to connect to a remote VNC display with a password
	- user types the wrong password
	- A dialog pops up indicating that authentication failed and asking if the user
	  would like to try to re-connect.
	- User clicks 'Yes'
	- Because the connection was disconnected, all windows are closed
	- remote-viewer tries to reconnect again, at which point a new display window is
	  opened, and the window gets placed by the window manager (possibly on another
	  monitor altogether).

	As a user, I expect the program to simply re-use the existing window when trying
	to re-authenticate, instead of having the window disappear and then re-appear at
	a different location.  This patch accomplishes that.

	Move vnc-specific auth logic to VirtViewerSessionVnc

	Improve window title when connected to newer spice-server
	Recent spice servers send the guest vm name and uuid to the client.  We can use
	these values to display the proper vm name in the window title if a title is not
	specified on the commandline. We can also be smarter about the title in
	virt-viewer as well.

	If a title is specified on the comamndline (-t/--title=foo), we use that.  If not,
	we fall back to the vm name.  If that is empty, we fall back to the uri of the
	connection.

	Display warning if UI file fails
	When trying to load ui files, we try to find the file in several directories.
	If a file is not found in one directory, try to load it from the next directory.
	However, if a file is found in a directory but we are not able to load it (e.g.
	due to unsupported versions of glade used to generate it, etc), we should print
	a warning to the terminal to help the developer debug the issue.

	This is an unexpected failure (whereas not finding the file in that directory at
	all is an 'expected' failure).

	Update for 0.6.0 release

	Refresh translations

	Fix virt-viewer.exe on win32
	Libvirt uses gnulib for making winsock look like POSIX
	sockets. This means that in the libvirt event handle
	callbacks the application will be given a file descriptor
	rather than a winsock HANDLE object. The g_io_channel_unix_new
	method will detect that it is an FD and delegate to the
	g_io_channel_win32_new_fd method. Unfortunately the glib Win32
	event loop impl is not very good at dealing with FD objects,
	simulating poll() by doing a read() on the FD :-(

	The API docs for g_io_channel_win32_new_fd say

	 "All reads from the file descriptor should be done by
	  this internal GLib thread. Your code should call only
	  g_io_channel_read()."

	This isn't going to fly for libvirt, since it has zero
	knowledge of glib at all, so is just doing normal read().

	Fortunately we can work around this problem by turning
	the FD we get from libvirt back into a HANDLE using the
	_get_osfhandle() method.

	Load ui files first from installed location
	virt_viewer_util_load_ui() looks first in the current directory, and then looks
	in the system data dirs for a ui file to load, but if you install virt-viewer in
	a different prefix, it will load the system UI file rather than the one from the
	install prefix. Try to load the ui file from pkgdatadir first.

	Enable the display before showing the window
	This ensures that the display is enabled when it gets its first Allocate event
	(which causes a display reconfiguration).  If the display is not enabled at this
	point, it won't send down a new monitors_config message until the second
	allocation, which may result in the display being disabled until a window is
	resized.

	Create a sparse array for monitor-geometry-changed
	It's possible to have only display N enabled without having all of the displays
	before it. I experienced this a couple times with a windows guest where display
	1 would show up before display 0 and we'd hit a warning that nth is not less
	than nmonitors. So find the highest display ID and then create an array of that
	size, leaving missing displays initialized to 0

	Don't re-configure displays when show-hint changes
	This caused secondary displays on a windows guest to flicker under some
	circumstances. The old code didn't re-configure displays in this case either, so
	it shouldn't have been included in the display alignment refactor.

	Do all display alignment in virt-viewer
	Don't rely on spice-gtk to do any alignment of displays.  This patch sets the
	disable-display-align property on the SpiceMainChannel, and makes the
	VirtViewerSession in charge of doing all alignment. This means that every
	display has to tell the VirtViewerSession when its "virtual monitor" has changed
	configuration (and wants to reconfigure its display on the guest), rather than
	sending it directly to the Main Channel.  The session will then align the
	displays (if necessary), and the spice session will send down new configuration
	for all displays at once. This solves a couple of problems:

	1. It allows the session to send down absolute coordinates only in the case
	   where *all* windows are fullscreen (so that we can still support
	   vertically-stacked displays, etc).  But it auto-aligns displays if only a
	   subset of the displays are in fullscreen mode. This solves the problem of
	   overlapping regions on different displays when one monitor is in fullscreen
	   because only one monitor's configuration was updated and the others were not
	   aligned.
	2. Allows us to always align based on the current position of each display. This
	   contrasts with the earlier behavior where the position used for alignment was
	   the window's position at the time when it was last resized. This caused
	   displays to be arranged in a seemingly non-deterministic manner if one window
	   was moved and then another window was resized (causing a display
	   re-configuration).

	Ensure all windows obey initial --zoom setting
	There are cases where multiple VirtViewerWindow objects are created before the
	VirtViewerApp constructor has a chance to run. Since the constructor has not yet
	run, priv->main_window will still be NULL, the test in
	virt_viewer_app_window_new() will fail, and they will not get their initial zoom
	level set.  When the constructor finally runs, it set the zoom level of the main
	window to the value set on the command line, but all other windows that had
	already been created retained the default 100% zoom level.

	By creating the main_window in the instance init function, we ensure that the
	main window is created before we get any 'session-display-added' signals and all
	displays will start out with consistent zoom levels.

	Remove non-functional VIRT_VIEWER_HIDE env behavior
	VIRT_VIEWER_HIDE could be set as an environment variable to (theoretically) hide
	displays whenever they were not ready.  Unfortunately, this bit of functionality
	appears bitrotten and doesn't work anymore (it prevents windows from opening
	when you click 'view > displays > display 2', for instance).

2013-11-20  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@redhat.com>

	separate fullscreen_set_active into a separate function

	Ensure auto-conf is only done once
	Auto-conf should only happen at startup. It is triggered from several places due
	to the somewhat unreliable ordering of events, but that doesn't mean we want to
	run it several times. This patch ensures that we only do it once.

	Add ability to define custom display->monitor mapping per vm
	Fullscreen mode generally just assigns display 1 to monitor 1, display 2 to
	monitor 2, etc. For custom setups, you can define a monitor mapping in the
	settings keyfile per-vm. This requires a vm uuid (so only works in virt-viewer
	or on versions of spice-server that send the uuid over the wire).  The format is
	pretty basic:

	    [6485b20f-e9da-614c-72b0-60a7857e7886]
	    monitor-mapping=2;3

	The group name ("6485b20f-e9da-614c-72b0-60a7857e7886") is the uuid id of the
	vm. This group has a single key: monitor-mapping. This key is an array of
	integers describing the order in which to assign the monitors to a guest
	display. Any monitors that are not listed in this array will not be configured
	at startup.  For instance:

	    monitor-mapping=2;1

	will attempt to configure 2 displays on the guest and assign the first display
	to monitor 2 and the second display to monitor 1.

	    monitor-mapping=2

	will only configure a single display on the guest and place it on the second
	monitor.  Any monitor numbers listed in the keyfile are greater than the number
	of monitors that are physically present, they will be ignored.

	Fix leak of VirtViewerApp::windows hash table key
	The VirtViewerApp::windows hash table owns the memory for both the keys
	and values it stores. virt_viewer_app_remove_nth_window() uses
	g_hash_table_steal() which does not call the 'free' function neither for
	the key nor for the value. This method takes care of releasing the
	reference for the value it extracted from the hash table, but not for the
	key.
	This commit fixes by explicitly taking a reference on the value rather than
	stealing the one held by the hash table. We can then replace the use of
	g_hash_table_steal() with g_hash_table_remove() which will take care of
	freeing the removed key.

	session: Don't hold VirtViewerDisplay refs on channel destroy
	VirtViewerSessionSpice creates a reference-holding VirtViewerDisplay
	array and associates it with the display SpiceChannel with
	g_object_set_data(channel, "virt-viewer-displays").

	When virt_viewer_session_spice_channel_destroy() is called and the display
	channel is being destroyed, we should ensure these VirtViewerDisplay
	references are dropped or the displays could outlive the session.

	In my testing (start qemu with a f20 live cd, connect to it, when the
	kernel has started booting and qxl is initialized (4 displays listed in the
	display submenu), kill qemu), I was getting "invalid unclassed pointer in

	Hide all windows on disconnection
	When starting remote-viewer without argument, we are showing a
	window where the user can enter connection details. We then
	go on to try and connect to the URI the user specified, and if
	the connection fails, we disconnect from the remote server, and then
	we show again the connection window so that the user can correct the
	URI if he entered it wrong.
	However, when this happens, the window for the previous connection
	will still be visible even if connection failed. To avoid this,
	this commit makes sure we hide all windows when we get a disconnection
	event.

	Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1024309

	Reshow connection dialog on errors
	remote-viewer behaviour is currently inconsistent in the connection dialog:
	if the user enters a valid URI, but then remote-viewer fails to connect
	to it, then we'll show again the connection dialog through a call
	to virt_viewer_app_start() in remote_viewer_deactivated(). If instead we
	enter an invalid URI in the connection dialog, then remote-viewer will
	report an error and quit.

	This commit makes sure in the latter case, we report the error and show
	again the connection dialog. The user can press 'Cancel' in the
	connection dialog to get out of remote-viewer as in this case, we
	return directly FALSE rather than going through the cleanup: label
	and looping.

	Handle virt_viewer_app_start() errors
	remote_viewer_deactivated() can be calling virt_viewer_app_start()
	without checking whether it returns TRUE or FALSE. It returns FALSE
	when it was not successful (when it failed to parse the URI to connect
	to for example, or whe the user presses Cancel in the connection dialog).

	This means that if the user starts remote-viewer, enters a valid URI
	in the connection dialog to which it cannot connect to
	(spice://example.com:999) and then presses Cancel in the connection
	dialog that appears after the connection  failure, then remote-viewer
	will be sitting there with an empty window doing nothing.

	This commit ensures we chain to the parent class when
	virt_viewer_app_start() returns FALSE, which causes remote-viewer to
	exit.

	Fix window title after failed connection
	When using the connection dialog, if the user picks an invalid
	URI first causing a failed connection, and then picks/enters a valid
	URI, remote-viewer window title will be set to the first invalid URI,
	not to the second one which was entered.

	As the user may have specified a window title to use on the command
	line (-t option), we need to be careful not to override that when
	setting the window title on the second attempt.

	Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1024309

	build-sys: Use gtk+ 3.0 by default
	virt-viewer currenty builds with gtk+ 2.0 by default. Nowadays, gtk+ 2.0 is

	gtk+ 3.0. This commit switches the default to gtk+ 3.0

	Disconnect fullscreen map-event handler when leaving fullscreen
	When we enter fullscreen mode before the window is shown, we set up a signal
	handler to enter fullscreen mode when the window is mapped.  If we then leave
	fullscreen mode before the window is mapped, we don't disconnect this handler,
	so it will still enter fullscreen mode when it is shown.

	Fixes rhbz #1009513

	Drop basic fullscreen mode
	Remove the distinction between --full-screen and --full-screen=auto-conf.  Just
	make --full-screen behave like auto-conf did.  There's really no advantage to
	having two slightly different fullscreen startup modes.

	ovirt: Only set SPICE CA cert if it's non NULL
	We currently reuse the oVirt CA cert for SPICE connection as well,
	but it may not be set. When this happens, we don't want to try to use
	it.

	ovirt: Don't automatically download CA certificate
	The CA certificate to use to authenticate the various hosts in
	an oVirt instance can be fetched from https://ovirt.example.com/ca.crt.
	However, the gio API we are using does not seem to be checking the
	server-side certificate of ovirt.example.com before connecting to it,
	which could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. Now that the CA
	certificate to use can be specified from the command line using
	--ovirt-ca-file, we can remove this automatic fetching of the CA
	certificate.

	ovirt: Honour oVirt command line options
	libgovirt 0.3.0 and newer can be passed from the commandline a CA
	certificate to use during SSL communications. This commit adds support
	for this option to remote-viewer.

	Clean-up spaces before/after URI in connection dialog
	When starting remote-viewer with no argument, a connection dialog
	is shown. If the URI the user types in this dialog as trailing
	or leading spaces, then connection will fail because remote-viewer
	will keep them as if they were significant.
	This commit makes sure we remove spaces at the beginning/end of
	the URI before trying to use it.

	Make 'Send' menu items with defined accels work in fullscreen

	Set Spice display to fullscreen if owning window is pending fullscreen
	When you call virt_viewer_window_enter_fullscreen() on a hidden window, it
	didn't actually change its fullscreen state.  Instead, it sets up a map-event
	handler to enter fullscreen after it is shown. When _set_display() is called on
	a window that is pending fullscreen status, it initially sets the fullscreen
	state of the display to FALSE, which can cause an unwanted resize to be sent
	down to the guest. This patch changes the behavior to set its fullscreen state
	to TRUE even before the window is shown.

	Don't freeze property notifications when adding new displays
	Freezing property notifications prevents VirtViewerDisplaySpice from
	synchronizing its fullscreen/auto-resize state with the base class until after
	the notifications are thawed.  During the time that notifications were frozen,
	an allocation happens. The action we take on an allocation event depends on the
	current state of the auto_resize variable, so this can result in an unwanted
	resize.

	VirtViewerDisplaySpice: use enum type for auto_resize
	Instead of storing the auto_resize member as an integer, use the enum, it makes
	it slightly easier for debugging. Also, explicitly initialize the value.

	Avoid extra zoom-level property notifications
	When setting a display's zoom level to the same level as the current setting,
	return early so that we don't notify about a property change

	Don't disable fullscreen if kiosk mode is off
	This conflicts with the --full-screen switch, because if kiosk mode is disabled,
	it sets disables fullscreen mode, which overrides the earlier call to enable
	fullscreen.

	Make 'Cancel' the default action in exit dialog
	In the 'Do you want to close the session dialog?', the default focus
	is currently on the 'Do not ask me again' checkbox.
	The purpose of this dialog is to make sure that the user does not
	inadvertantly exit remote-viewer, this commit changes the default
	action in this dialog to be 'cancel' rather than switching the
	'Do not ask me again 'checkbox.

	Update hotkeys documentation in manpage
	Describe the expected behavior of the hotkey bindings in a bit more detail.

	Add ability to use 'End' key in hotkeys
	ctrl_key_to_gtk_key() capitalizes all key names not explicitly specified in the
	translation table.  So 'end' becomes 'END', which is not a valid key name
	according to GTK+.  Un-comment out the 'end' item from the table and set it to
	the properly capitalized key name ("End").

	This allows users to specify e.g. "ctrl+alt+end" as a hotkey for
	sending the secure attention sequence.

	Add ability to send Secure attention sequence via keyboard
	On Windows, the OS doesn't allow applications to handle Ctrl+Alt+Del, because
	it's handled by the OS at a much lower level. Although we have a menu item to
	send this sequence to the guest, it's not possible to send via the keyboard (in
	the windows client). So add an alternative key sequence (defaulting to
	Ctrl+Alt+End) to send this sequence to the guest.

	kiosk: explicit resize window to fullscreen size
	Allow to run the client in kiosk mode with window-manager-less
	environment.

	This was a conditional workaroud on win32. I am making it
	non-conditional to make fullscreen work on non-wm environment. Hence
	I don't see the need to refer explicitely to the bug workaround, since
	it is no longer something that should be removed, even when bgo 652049
	is fixed.

	kiosk: don't open extra monitors
	In kiosk mode, we don't want new monitors windows that wouldn't fit on
	the client monitors to come up.

	kiosk: warn and prevent if app want to quit or window to hide
	These condition shouldn't happen, they are here for debugging
	purposes (ie file a bug if it happens).

	kiosk: add --kiosk-quit option
	In kiosk mode, it's useful to keep the app alive, even if the remote
	session ended for example. Ie, we want to prevent the app from quiting
	itself, even if the remote end closed, lost network, or crashed etc.

	kiosk: teach a window to become kiosk-mode
	Remove the toolbar, disable modifiers.

	kiosk: keep a reference on the toolbar
	We are going to change the container content dynamically, so we need a
	strong reference.

	kiosk: use less verbose window/display status
	We want extra windows to remain blank after connection.

	For example, if the remote has a single monitor, and client has more, we
	don't want extra client monitors to say "Connected to graphic server"
	all the time on other monitors. Instead, we leave them empty/black in
	kiosk mode.

	kiosk: open a window on each client monitor
	Open a window on each client monitor in fullscreen. If the remote
	display has less monitors than the client, the extra client monitors
	will still be used to prevent the user from accessing the windows or
	desktop below, and also to show some status messages when necessary.

	kiosk: add app kiosk option, pass it down to window
	See man page update for details.

	Return existing window in app_window_new()
	Since the returned window is weak, it can already returns existing
	windows (instead of creating one and failing to insert).

	This allows the following set_kiosk() function to create a main window
	before the app constructor is called.

	Define the min/max zoom levels, so all values are sync

	Try to share more GOption code between r-v and v-v

	The fix 0dca975d64fcf0782ec7b3e3bd965f1bcf47c528 make the first window

	wxs: add usb.ids and keyboard-shortcuts.png

	Hide extra monitors that don't fit in auto-conf
	Virt-viewer sometimes opens one too many windows if the guest is

	some race). Instead, let's hide extra monitors that wouldn't fit in
	auto-conf.

	virt-viewer: Allow TLS-only SPICE connections
	When trying to connect to a VM which uses SPICE with only a tls port
	set:
	<graphics type='spice' tlsPort='-1' autoport='no' listen='0' keymap='en-us'>
	    <listen type='address' address='0'/>
	</graphics>
	the connection will fail with
	"Cannot determine the graphic address for the guest spice"

	virt_viewer_extract_connect_info() indeed assumes that if no
	non-TLS port is set, then this means we are trying to connect through
	an already open socket, and otherwise the connection fails.
	The presence of a TLS port is only checked when a non-TLS port is set.

	This commit reworks that logic to start by extracting both the non-TLS
	and TLS ports (only when using SPICE for the latter), and by only trying
	to parse the socket to use if none of these 2 ports is set

	This fixes rhbz#982840

	Before this patch-set virt-viewer was calling spice_session_has_channel_type(
	session, SPICE_CHANNEL_USBREDIR) from the session-initialized signal handler,

	gtk-3: Rework window size handling
	With gtk-2 we have a special hack, where at first we make the
	virt-viewer-display request its actual size, and then once the window is
	mapped, we request a size of 50x50 to allow the user to resize the window
	to something smaller.

	With gtk-3 >= 3.8.1 this is broken, and the window gets resized to a
	smaller size as soon as we change the size request to 50x50.

	gtk-3 has a much better way of dealing with this in the form of widgets
	being able to specify both a minimal and a natural size. This patch changes
	virt-viewer to use this with gtk-3, instead of the gtk-2 hack.

	ovBox: Make get_preferred_width/height differentiate between min and natural

	virt-viewer-app: Always allow users to close displays from the displays menu
	Marking display menu items as non sensitive for shown displays make no sense,
	since the user can always close them through the window-manager.

	Having a window for a display shown when the display is not selectable nor
	ready, can happen when the agent goes away. This happens for example when using
	a dual monitor config with a Linux guest and then switching to a text console
	inside the guest.

	Use translations when looking up key combination to send
	virt_viewer_window_menu_send() compares the label of the menu item
	that was clicked on with a list of known labels to know which
	key combination should be sent to the guest.
	However, the menu label can be translated, but the table doing
	the label -> key combination mapping uses untranslated labels.
	This means the menu item will not send any key combination when
	clicked if translated.
	This can be observed with fr_FR where "Ctrl+Alt+_Del" is translated
	to "Ctrl+Alt+_Suppr".

	Remove gtk_window_present() call

	Gtk+ ShowWindow() is currently using SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE, it should

	virt-viewer-display-spice: Skip monitor info in fullscreen-auto-conf mode
	When we are in fullscreen-auto-conf virt-viewer-session-spice sends a
	monitor-info message to the agent with the exact client monitor info, and
	virt-viewer-display-spice should not override that.

	Forward directly key events to display
	Even if the display is disabled, we should keep sending key events to
	guest. It can wake up from sleep for instance.

	There is a single widget per window, so we can directly send key
	events there. If the menu is active, it has the grab, so the window
	doesn't receive those key events.

	virt-viewer-app: Call virt_viewer_app_update_menu_displays on show_hint change
	Since the sensitivity of the display menu-check-items depends on show_hint,
	we need to call virt_viewer_app_update_menu_displays on show_hint change.

	This fixes the following scenario:
	1) Linux guest with upto 4 displays on a single qxl dev
	2) Configure it for 2 displays
	3) Switch to a text-console in the guest (ie send ctrl+alt+F3)
	4) All displays except for disp 1 are now not sensitve in the menu
	5) Switch back to X
	6) The second display in the view->displays menu is still not sensitive

	virt-viewer-display: Document difference between nth display and monitor

	virt-viewer-window: Don't use priv->display when it is NULL
	Add some missing checks for not having a display. Note that where
	functions should not be called (ie menu items should be disabled) I've
	used g_return_if_fail.

	virt-viewer-window: Store the monitor locally
	With commit 81ed9d13 "virt_viewer_window_enter_fullscreen: Pass in monitor for
	fullscreen window" we need a monitor number to determine where to move
	the window when going fullscreen.

	Since the VirtViewerDisplay needs to know the fullscreen monitor number too,
	to determine the fullscreen size it was being stored there. But we don't
	always have a display, leading to errors like:

	(remote-viewer:7996): remote-viewer-CRITICAL **:
	virt_viewer_display_get_monitor: assertion `VIRT_VIEWER_IS_DISPLAY(self)'
	failed

	And to the monitor number not always being stored. This patchset fixes this
	by storing the monitor number inside VirtViewerWindow, and passing it to
	VirtViewerDisplay only when we've a display.

	virt-viewer-display-spice: Use display monitor property for fullscreen size
	When a display is pinned to a certain monitor for fullscreen, it will be moved
	there when going fullscreen. Currently we use gdk_screen_get_monitor_at_window
	to determine which monitor we are on and get the size from that monitor.

	But this is racy, sometimes the size_allocate function runs before the move
	has finished and we get the size from the wrong monitor:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=918570

	Since if the display is pinned to a certain monitor, the display will always
	end up on that monitor we can avoid the race by simply using that monitors
	size.

	virt_viewer_window_enter_fullscreen: Pass in monitor for fullscreen window
	Rather then passing in a move boolean + coordinates to move the window
	to for fullscreen mode, simply pass in the monitor, so that the underlying
	objects can also use the monitors size to determine the display size.

	Note: pass in -1 to use the monitor the window is currently on.

	virtviewer-window: Make sure fullscreen window stays on the same monitor
	Sometimes the guest may shortly disable and then re-enable a monitor while
	in fullscreen mode, this happens for example when changing display resolution
	through gnome-display-properties inside the guest. This causes the client
	window-manager to remap the window, and this can cause it to end up
	on a different monitor.

	This patch fixes this by remembering the position the window is places at
	when going fullcreen and moving it there again when its gets (re-)shown.

	Fix "Do not ask me again" checkbox settings saving
	Based on bug report by Hans:

	The code block for saving was below this check:

	    if (priv->session) {
	        virt_viewer_session_close(VIRT_VIEWER_SESSION(priv->session));
	        if (priv->connected) {
	            priv->quiting = TRUE;
	            return;
	        }
	    }

	Which means it never executes when quiting virt-viewer while conneced, causing
	the "Do not ask me again" checkbox settings to not be saved.

	usbredir: Fix usbredir menu always being grayed out on monitor 2+

	virt-viewer-display-spice: Pass proper x and y coordinates in windowed mode
	This stops monitor order from the guest from being re-arranged in multi-
	monitor setups when switching between fullscreen and windowed mode.

	Note this relies on spice-gtk's auto monitor alignment code, which currently
	does not properly handle setups where there is more then 1 row of monitors,
	ie 2x1 - 5x1 will work fine, but 2x2 will not.

	virt-viewer-display-spice: Use real monitor coordinates in fullscreen
	Now that we pass the real monitor coordinates, tell spice-gtk to use them,
	rather then to use the passed coordinates as input for its automatic monitor
	alignment. This fixes ie monitors in a 2x2 grid, showing up as a 4x1
	configuration in the guest.

	Use a common early init() function
	There is a number of things both virt-viewer and remote-viewer need to
	do early during execution. Do it only in one place.

	windows: add debug-helper
	This is a simple program that will set some debug variable, and run
	gdb and wait until it finished. This makes it possible to debug
	"remote-viewer --spice-controller" easily, by setting the necessary
	variables and keeping the parent process running (the activex whatches
	its death)

	To use it, replace the HKCU "Software\spice-space.org\spicex\client"
	value "$INSTDIR\bin\remote-viewer.exe --spice-controller" with
	"$INSTDIR\bin\debug-helper.exe remote-viewer.exe --spice-controller".

	nsis: add deps.txt file in installer
	This helps track package version that were used during the
	build of Windows installer. It's not ideal, but make up the
	lack of package management on windows

	spice: only autoresize once with screen size in fullscreen
	It's currently not possible to configure guest with higher resolution
	than native, as it will switch back to native, since the gtk widget
	allocation will always end up being the size of the screen. We
	special-case fullscreen mode, and only resize when entering
	fullscreen. Furthermore, it avoids sending extra unnecessary resize
	events to the guest whenever gtk+ call size allocate in various
	stages, with different values.

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=864929

	spice: avoid rounding issues when scaling up display
	Fix some unwanted guest resize due to rounding issues (at least when
	scaling up)

	We may want to save the original remote desktop size, instead of
	always checking widget requisition. That way zooming shouldn't resize
	guest at all, but it seems tricky to handle that special case vs user
	window resize that should trigger guest resize.

2012-10-16  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	Do not resize window to minimum when toggling auto-resize
	The virt_viewer_display_idle() will queue a resize event that will
	result in display size requisition of 50x50. If we later resize the
	window to 1x1 in virt_viewer_window_resize() we end up with a tiny
	window.

	It is legitimate not to force that 1x1 window resize when toggling the
	option. After the rest of the logic in virt_viewer_window_resize(), if
	the remote desktop ends up being resize, that will trigger another
	virt_viewer_set_desktop_size() and finally change the window size
	appropriately.

	Fix check for IPv6 any address
	The string '::' is just one of many possible ways to express
	the IPv6 "any" address. Others include  '::0', '0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0',
	'0::0' and more. Instead of trying to do strcmp, actually try
	parsing the address with GInetAddress and then simply use an
	accessor to check what type it is

	Allow user to set a window title for remote-viewer

	Use real binary name in help message
	Now that we have 2 distinct binaries, remote-viewer and virt-viewer,
	'PACKAGE' can no longer be used in error messages as the name of the
	binary. This causes a small inconsistency when running
	'remote-viewer --foobar' as the error message would be:
	'Unknown option --foobar
	Run 'virt-viewer --help' to see a full list of available command line options'

	This commit makes sure we use argv[0] for this message.
	Fixes rhbz#814150

2012-07-23  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	Show status page by default if display not ready
	Switch back to status page if display is not ready.

	Make status widget visible immediately
	GtkNotebook will use the currently visible widget as default page.
	If we don't show status widget before we append the display, the
	current page will be on display. Quoting Gtk+ documentation:

	"Note that due to historical reasons, GtkNotebook refuses to switch to
	a page unless the child widget is visible. Therefore, it is
	recommended to show child widgets before adding them to a notebook."

	vnc: when session is disconnected, make the display as non-ready

	Simplify display flag handling

	Add VirtViewerSession::session-display-updated
	Rebuild menu when agent is connected. Only when the agent is running
	may a display be enabled/disabled.

	Make the display submenu insensitive if display can't be selected

	spice: factor out main channel lookup code

	Add VirtViewerDisplay::selectable property
	This property will be set when the display can be selected to be
	"enabled" and shown (this can involve creating/connecting an
	additional guest monitor, and may need guest agent cooperation for
	example).

	Add virt_viewer_window_get_display()
	Getter used in following changes.

	Hook up handling of Monitors
	Rely on spice-gtk display channel monitors property to manage
	displays. The same display channel may now provide several monitors,
	the SpiceDisplay widget must be told which monitor to display

	Bump glib > 2.22, add compat file
	We use API from 2.22, and some from further version. Add
	virt-glib-compat.h fallback file for those.

	Use SpiceDisplay:ready property instead of channel mark
	The display can now check several conditions before the display can be
	shown, use that instead of display mark, which was not high-level
	enough.

	Number display starting from 1

	Prevent from adding the same display several time in the session
	In virt_viewer_session_spice_display_monitors(), we (re)add the
	display unconditionnaly every time we receive a new MonitorConfig.

	Add a DISABLED display hint
	This flag will help to track whether the display has been
	removed/closed and whether it really has a valid display.

	Ready in contrast, is used to "hide" temporarily the display (when
	starting or redrawing the display, to avoid artifacts)

	Use virt_viewer_connect_object() for display
	When display is released, detach signal automatically.

	Fix various crash related to not cleaning up signal handlers properly,
	due to no longer 1-1 only relation between display widget and channel.

	Rebuild display menu when a window is added or removed

	Mark a menu string as translatable

	Run-time check values before doing bad computation

	Turn display:show-hint into flags type

	Destroy dialog immediately after run
	If the parent is already destroyed, it looks like the dialog is
	destroyed too. This avoids a crash when calling app_quit().

	build: generate enums type boilerplate

	spice: disconnect signal handlers when either object is destroyed
	Use virt_viewer_signal_connect_object(), a copy of telepathy
	utility function tp_g_signal_connect_object(). This function
	will take care of removing signal handler if any of emitter or
	attached object are destroyed.

	The following patches will have this condition met, since there is no
	longer 1-1 relation between channel and display. The channels can
	continue to be around when some of the display are removed.

	spice: improve fullscreen=auto-conf
	Do keep client monitor position, do not align monitors automatically.
	The align property is only available since v0.12.101.

2012-07-03  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>

	build: allow building with newer glibc-headers and -O0
	    Fix copied from libvirt, commit by Eric Blake.

	    glibc 2.15 (on Fedora 17) coupled with explicit disabling of
	    optimization during development dies a painful death:

	    /usr/include/features.h:314:4: error: #warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O) [-Werror=cpp]

	    Work around this by only conditionally defining _FORTIFY_SOURCE,
	    in the case where glibc can actually use it.  The trick is using
	    AH_VERBATIM instead of AC_DEFINE.

2012-06-15  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Revert "Fix virt_viewer_app_activate return value"
	This reverts commit 3ce6df7c309068f36e2602692da809a153ed5688. This
	commit broke virt-viewer which expects this function to return -1
	or 0 on error, and a positive value on success in
	virt_viewer_initial_connect.

2012-06-13  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix virt_viewer_app_activate return value
	VirtViewerApp::activate is expected to return -1 on errors.
	It calls the VirtViewerSession::open_* methods, which return FALSE
	on error. However, VirtViewerApp::activate directly returns these
	boolean instead of testing the returned value and properly returning
	-1 on errors. This caused errors in these open methodes to be ignored.

	Avoid race condition when disposing of app
	When disposing of the VirtViewerApp, we free the hash table
	containing the windows. This causes each window to be freed,
	which in turn causes the visibility callback to be invoked.
	This can then get NULL pointers from the self->priv->windows
	usage.

	Blank out priv->windows before unrefing the hashs and add
	a check to ensure priv->windows is non-NULL.

	Ensure windows are destroyed when display closes
	When running virt-viewer with the --reconnect argument, when

	Fix automatic usb redir through controller
	remote-viewer is currently trying to use
	SpiceUsbDeviceManager::auto-connect to control whether USB devices
	should be automatically connected or not. However, this property
	is more or less an internal spice-gtk property which is toggled
	by SpiceGtkSession when the SPICE widget gets/loses focus.

	SpiceGtkSession has an "auto-usbredir" property which can be used
	by applications to enable/disable automatic usb redirection through
	SPICE. Since this property is helpfully bound to
	VirtViewerSession::auto-usbredir, use this when the controller
	is told to enable/disable USB redirection.

	Without this change, automatic USB redirection will always get reenabled
	as soon as there's a focus change since SpiceGtkSession::auto-usbredir
	defaults to be enabled in spice-gtk.

	Minor simplification/optimization of VirtViewerDisplay

2012-04-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix typo in variable names for Win32 command helper

	Fix close of VNC displays
	When clicking the close button on a virt-viewer window with
	a VNC session open, while the VNC session terminates, the
	window does not go away.

	The problem is that the virt_viewer_session_vnc_disconnected
	method never gets invoked. The close button triggers a call
	to virt_viewer_session_clear_displays which unrefs the
	VirtViewerDisplayVnc instance. This in turn triggers a call
	to gtk_container_destroy, which destroys all widgets it
	contains, ie the VncDisplay * object.

	With the VncDisplay object in its dispose phase, no signals
	will ever be emitted, thus the 'vnc-disconnected' signal
	never gets seen.

	The design issue is that VirtViewerDisplayVnc is assuming
	it owns the VncDisplay, whereas in fact the real owner is
	the VirtViewerSessionVnc object.

	The solution is to introduce a new virt_viewer_display_close
	method which can be used to de-parent the widget before
	VirtViewerDisplay is unref'd.

	The VirtViewerSessionVnc object also needs to hold a full ref
	on the VncDisplay object, not merely a floating reference

	* virt-viewer-display-spice.c, virt-viewer-display.c,
	  virt-viewer-display.h: Add virt_viewer_display_close

	virt-viewer-window: Add a USB device selection to the fullscreen menu (v2)
	Note this button only gets shown on USB redir capable virtual machines.

	Changes in v2:
	-Use gtk_widget_set_visible for simpler code

	window: Call virt_viewer_app_quit instead of gtk_main_quit
	When quiting from the fullscreen menu call virt_viewer_app_quit instead of
	gtk_main_quit so that the session gets properly disconnected before quiting.

	virt_viewer_app_quit: Cleanly close the connection before quiting
	Even though the previous patches in this series ensure that the session
	gets properly finalized, we still need to wait for the disconnect signal,
	as spice-glib uses co-routines which need some time to cleanly close the
	connection / session.

	session-spice: Delay the disconnected signal till all channels are closed
	Before this patch session-spice would emit the disconnected signal as soon
	as the main channel is closed, but other channels may still be open at
	that time and raising the disconnected signal usally leads to the app class
	calling gtk_main_quit, at which point the other channels never get properly
	finalized (as there co-routines still hold a reference to them).

	This is esp. bad for usbredir channels as these re-attach the kernel driver
	for redirected devices when finalized. So exiting without properly finalizing
	them leads to the formerly redirected devices not being usuable until the
	driver is manually reloaded or the device is unplugged and re-plugged
	(the kernel does not automatically re-bind kernel drivers when userspace
	 closes a usbfs node).

	This patch fixes this by delaying the emitting of the disconnect signal
	until the last channel has been destroyed.

	virt-viewer-app: unref the session on dispose
	With this patch combined with the previous patches in this series, the
	VirtViewerSession (finally) gets properly finalized on exit.

	virt-viewer-display: Use a borrowed reference to session
	Before this patch there was a cyclic reference between VirtViewerSesion and
	VirtViewerDisplay, since all VirtViewerDisplays are created / destroyed by
	VirtViewerSession it is safe to assume that lifetime of VirtViewerSession >=
	VirtViewerDisplay, so VirtViewerDisplay can take a borrowed reference
	breaking the circle, and allowing proper cleanup on exit.

	Note that there is no g_object_unref removed from virt-viewer-display, this
	because there is no finalize / dispose and before this patch
	VirtViewerDisplay never unref-ed the reference it hold to the session.

	virt-viewer-window: Use a borrowed reference to app
	Before this patch there was a cyclic reference between VirtViewerApp and
	VirtViewerWindow, since all VirtViewerWindows are created / destroyed by
	VirtViewerApp it is safe to assume that lifetime of VirtViewerApp >=
	VirtViewerWindow, so VirtViewerWindow can take a borrowed reference
	breaking the circle, and allowing proper cleanup on exit.

	virt-viewer-app: main_window is part of our windows hashtable
	This means that:
	1) There is no need to explictly set its title separately
	2) It is unref-ed when we do g_hash_table_unref(priv->windows), so it
	   should not be unref-ed separately otherwise it is unref-ed twice!

	Notice that 2 was never a problem because of circular references
	between VirtViewerApp and VirtViewerWindow, but once the follow
	up patch to this one breaks the circle 2 becomes an issue.

	session-spice: dispose should chain up to dispose not finalize!!

	usbredir: Gnome HIG-ify USB device selection dialog
	These changes match the changes already made to the spice-gtk
	usb device selection widget to match the spacing advised by the Gnome HIG.

	usbredir: Shrink the usb device selection dialog when devices are unplugged

	spice: fix connecting via ssh to a password-protected server
	spice_session_connect() will attempt to connect directly to the
	server, we need to continue calling spice_session_open_fd() for ssh
	tunnel to work.

	spice: fix double unref of main channel
	When doing unref() on a channel, channel-destroy signal may be emitted
	during object dispose time, and it will attempt to unref() the channel
	again likely leading to a crash.

	It may be that spice-gtk should have a different/simpler object
	life-cycle model, but it's also a good assumption to not take strong
	references on the channels, but just keep a weak reference as the
	session is really the channel life-cycle manager.

	Do not resize guest desktop if !auto-resize
	If auto-resize is enabled, the guest desktop size will be resized to
	match current window*zoom size.

	This can be a problem if the user explicitely set the desktop size to
	a different resolution and want to keep it. Disabling auto-resize
	sounds like a simple way to allow that.

	Resize Spice guest display to the container size
	The SpiceDisplay doesn't receive the full allocation, because
	VirtViewerDisplay maintains current aspect ratio. However, the guest
	display can be resize up to its container size.

	This fixes going full-screen and not getting native resolution for
	instance.

	Implement SPICE desktop resizing that takes account of zoom level
	The standard SPICE widget guest resize implementation does not
	take into account the zoom level settings in virt-viewer, because
	it has no knowledge of this functionality. The guest resize can,
	however, be done by calling spice_main_set_display() directly.
	This allows virt-viewer to resize the guest taking into account
	zoom levels.

	 ie, if virt-viewer is run with --zoom 50 and the window
	     is resized to 400x300, then the guest agent should
	     be told to set its resolution to 800x600

2012-02-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Revert support for resizing guest desktop
	The SpiceDisplay widget has built-in support for resizing the

	The difference is the ordering of the rules. With AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT

2011-11-07  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	build: make gtk-vnc optional

2011-11-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Require GTK-VNC 0.4.3 and remove redundant realize() call
	Remove call to gtk_widget_realize for the GTK-VNC widget. Requires
	GTK-VNC >= 0.4.3

2011-11-07  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Emit display-desktop-resize from set_desktop_size()

2011-11-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't include INSTALL file in GIT

	Revert 1a56de3acad6a19fd958fae9278cf1c97fdabb18
	The GLIB2 check previously removed was misleading because it in
	fact checked for gmodule-export-2.0 which is needed to export
	the signal handlers. Revert the previous commit, but rename the
	var to GMODULE2 to make it clearer

	Always use canonical URI from libvirt connection
	The URI we feed into libvirt may be an alias, so always query the
	actual URI used internally

2011-11-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update automated build to test both GTK2 and GTK3 builds

	Update mingw32 RPM specfile to use GTK3 on F15 or later

	Remove pkgconfig check for GLIB2 since it is implied by GTK2/3

2011-11-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix configure arg for disabling spice

	Print configuration summary

2011-10-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix broken keycombos for F9->F12 menu
	The table for sending C-A-Fn to guests had messed up mappings
	for F9->F12

	Wire up SpiceDisplay grab signals
	To ensure that we can put the key release sequence message in the
	title bar, wire up VirtViewerDisplaySpice to the grab signals
	in SpiceDisplay

	Fix setting of window title with --wait
	When waiting for a VM to appear or start, set the initial window
	title to the command line arg. When the VM actually appears then
	update it to the real VM name

2011-09-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix crash from previous commit when using UNIX sockets
	Code in the previous commit would use 'ghost' even when it was
	NULL, as with UNIX domain socket based connections.

2011-09-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix hostname when XML gives a wildcard address
	When the guest XML contains a wildcard address like 0.0.0.0 or ::,
	we can't directly use connect() on it. Instead we have to use the
	hostname/IP from the libvirt URI.

2011-09-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Propagate primary window zoom level to secondary windows
	Ensure that all windows get a default zoom level of 100. Propagate
	the primary window's zoom level to all secondary windows  when
	initially creating them

	Fix setting of window title with domain name

2011-08-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix setting of initial zoom level on display

2011-08-16  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	ff callbacks must be invoked from a clean stack
	If 'ff' callbacks are invoked directly from the remove
	callback they will likely deadlock in libvirt. They must
	be invoked from a clean stack, so switch to using a
	glib idle callback.

2011-08-14  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Don't print (null) as user

	Don't print incorrect port numbers
	The port isn't 22 when we connect to an alternate port given in
	.ssh/config.

	Don't hardcode ssh port to 0
	Many thanks to Luca Capello <luca@pca.it> for debugging this.

2011-08-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix inverted sshport test that broke SSH tunnelling

2011-08-04  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Return if xmlParseURI() failed, instead of crashing

	Lookup UI file correctly, to fix Windows support

	Mark exported function for gtkbuild to lookup on Windows

	Make title more translatable and using application name

	Use g_printerr for errors instead of fprintf(stderr,..)

	Lower severity of unhandled Spice events

	Add virt_viewer_app_show_display()
	Similar to previous virt_viewer_app_show_status().
	Used later on by Spice controller to switch between display and status.

	Fix fullscreen should hide taskbar on Windows

2011-08-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update for 0.4.1 release

	Update authors & copyright dates

	Fix sort order of displays submenu

2011-08-03  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Don't hardcode SSH port to 22
	To allow $HOME/.ssh/config to override the default SSH port,
	don't hardcode '-p 22' in the command line.

2011-08-03  Pavel Raiskup  <praiskup@redhat.com>

	Remove unreachable condition in authentication dialog

2011-07-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove duplicated struct definition

2011-07-26  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	If only one display, fullscreen should be on the current display

	Show status on all open windows
	The split virt_viewer_notebook_show_status() to
	virt_viewer_notebook_show_status_va() is unnecessary
	in the end, but it's more future-proof.

	Add a "Displays" submenu, and warn when closing last display

	Don't ignore creation of secondary displays

	Use app fullscreen property instead of app.start() argument

	Implement app_set_fullscreen() to go over existing windows

	Show display and rise its window when we have the display show hint
	Track event for Spice, and imitate it for VNC.

	Change enter/leave fullscreen to take/restore position
	That allow positionning windows in multi-head.

	Also, get rid of window_state_cb, since it's impossible to
	properly catch the event to do the right thing, ie move to a different
	screen before go full-screen, or disallow it in case nb physical
	monitors < nb virtual monitors.

	Add nth window to virt_viewer_app_window_new()

	Introduce fullscreen property and virt_viewer_app_set_fullscreen()

	Let virt_viewer_notebook_show_status take varags

	Status messages can be translated

	Add show-hint property to display

	Split VirtViewerApp window into VirtViewerWindow

2011-07-22  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Inherit from VirtViewerApp for VirtViewer
	Make it a real GObject.

	The parts specific to virt should go in virt-viewer.c

	Turn VirtViewer into a VirtViewerApp object

	Split virt_viewer_start() and virt_viewer_new()

	Split virt_viewer_activate() and virt_viewer_set_domain()

	Split virt_viewer_create_session() out of virt_viewer_extract_connect_info()
	For future reusability

	Reorder _VirtViewer to make it easier to split with RemoteViewer

	Extract scheme in virt_viewer_extract_host()
	Needed for remote-viewer.

2011-07-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove use of AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT
	Since we already invoke the intltool macros, also invoking
	AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT is wrong and causes problems with the
	later makefile rules

2011-07-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix build requirements for GTK3

	Remove bogus hardcoded check for GTK2

	Disable SPICE unless on x86 architectures

	Fix compat with GTK 2.18.0

	Updates for 0.4.0 release

	Remove virt-viewer-priv.h from sources, since it is gone

	Remove duplicated typedefs

	Annotate unused variables

	Fix leak of graphics type attribute from XML

	Fix leak of command line arguments

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Split pull part of VirtViewerDisplay out into VirtViewerSession
	To facilitate introduction of multi-head support, pull some of
	the VirtViewerDisplay class out into a new VirtViewerSession
	class.

	Avoid (null) in titlebar

	Fix colour of status label to show up on black background

	Fix reconnecting of SPICE display

2011-07-11  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Fill space on the display alignment with black

	Add support for --fullscreen option

	Skip non-primary monitors in SPICE

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove circular dependancy between VirtViewerDisplay and VirtViewer
	Add many signals to VirtViewerDisplay which are emitted when various
	events occur. This lets us remove all the code in the VirtViewerDisplay
	subclasses which call back into VirtViewer methods. Instead VirtViewer
	can simply connect signals to the display

	Turn VirtViewerDisplay into a proper Gtk widget
	Turn VirtViewerDisplay into a Gtk widget instead of just a GObject,
	by merging the functionality from VirtViewerAlign

2011-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Update to optionally build with GTK3

2011-07-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Replace use of GtkAlignment with a custom align widget
	To use the GtkAlignment we have to play evil tricks overriding
	its size request, to make it reallocate the child to the preferred
	size we desire based on the virtual desktop size + zoom level.

	By replacing the GtkAlignment with a custom widget we can
	directly implement the layout/sizing semantics we want without
	playing stupid games

	Introduce standard naming convention to files & methods
	All source files must be named

	  virt-viewer-XXXX

	All methods named

	  virt_viewer_XXX

2011-07-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix some compile warnings

	Convert from Glade to GtkBuilder

	Refactor configure.ac to pull out required version

	Enable use of scaling from spice >= 0.6
	Make the SPICE widget operate in the same way as the VNC widget
	with display scaling, and auto-resize, but preserving guest
	aspect ratio

	Hide menu bar on fullscreen & add a hiding toolbar
	* src/Makefile.am, src/view/autoDrawer.c, src/view/autoDrawer.c
	  src/view/drawer.c, src/view/drawer.h, src/view/ovBox.c,
	  src/view/ovBox.c: Import auto-drawer from vinagre
	* src/viewer-priv.h, src/viewer.c, src/viewer.glade,
	  src/display-vnc.c: Insert an auto-drawer above the
	  notebook and display an auto-hiding toolbar when fullscreen

2011-06-30  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add message about whether it is VNC or SPICE display

	Add some useful data for the --verbose flag

2011-05-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix re-connect after authentication failure
	viewer->display will be non-NULL if we have already attempted a
	connection. So, remove the check for it being NULL, and instead
	skip the widget setup step.

2011-05-23  Jiri Denemark  <Jiri.Denemark@gmail.com>

	Add support for listen attribute
	Virt-viewer now parses listen attribute from graphics element to be able
	to connect to domains configured with explicit listen address:

	    <graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' listen='123.45.67.89'/>

2011-05-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
