  Virt Viewer
  ===========

Virt Viewer provides a graphical viewer for the guest OS
display. At this time is supports guest OS using the VNC
or SPICE protocols. Further protocols may be supported in
the future as user demand dicatates. The viewer can connect
directly to both local and remotely hosted guest OS, optionally
using SSL/TLS encryption.

Virt Viewer can be built with either GTK2 or GTK3, with the
default option currently being GTK2. The choice can be made
with:

   ./configure --with-gtk=3.0  (or =2.0)

Virt Viewer uses the GTK-VNC widget to provide a display
of the VNC protocol. This is available from

  http://gtk-vnc.sourceforge.net/

Optionally Virt Viewer can also provide a SPICE client
using the SPICE-GTK widget (>= 0.6) available from

  http://spice-space.org/page/Spice-Gtk

Virt Viewer uses libvirt to lookup information about the
guest OS display. This is available from

  http://libvirt.org/

Further information about the Virt Viewer application can be
found on the Virt Manager website:
