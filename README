  Virt Viewer
  ===========

Virt Viewer provides a graphical viewer for the guest OS
display. At this time is supports guest OS using the VNC
protocol. Further protocols may be supported in the future
as user demand dicatates. The viewer can connect directly
to both local and remotely hosted guest OS, optionally
using SSL/TLS encryption.

Virt Viewer uses the GTK-VNC widget to provide a display
of the VNC protocol. This is available from

  http://gtk-vnc.sourceforge.net/

Virt Viewer uses libvirt to lookup information about the
guest OS display. This is available from

  http://libvirt.org/

Further information about the Virt Viewer application can be
found on the Virt Manager website:
